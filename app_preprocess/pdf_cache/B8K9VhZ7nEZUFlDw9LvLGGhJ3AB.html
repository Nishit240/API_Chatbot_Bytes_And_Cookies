<html><body><h3>Page 1</h3><p>Subject – Law of Contract-I UNIT – 1 Fundamentals of Contract Law L c aw of Contract is the most important and basic part of Mercantile Law. It is the foundation for many other laws falling in the category of mercantile laws. It is not only the mercantile or trader but every person who lives in the organised society, consciously or unconsciously enters into contract from sunrise to sunset. When a person hires a taxi, or orders something in a hotel or buys something form a shop,<br>purchases a newspaper, ride a bus etc. he actually enters into and performs contract though he may be unaware of this fact. Such contracts at times create legal relations giving rise to certain rights and obligations. e c. The Law relating to contracts in India is conntained in Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Act came into force with effect from September 1, 1872a. It is applicable to the whole of India except the State of Jammu & Kashmir (As per Section 1). s e s<br>g i<br>a e SCHEME OF THE ACT: The Act as enacted originally had 266 Sections divided into following Chapters:<br>n l l<br>e o Chapters Provisions Sections R C Preliminary S. 1 - 2 w.

Prior to this English Law of contract was followed in India. Law of contract creates jus in personam and not jus in rem. It extends to whole of India except state of Jammu and Kashmir.<br>OBJECTIVE OF THE ACT: The objective of the Contract Act, 1872 is to ensure that the rights and obligations arising out of a contract are honoured and that legal remedies are made available to an aggrieved party against the party failing to honour his part of agreement. Act lays down the basic principles of the formation, performance and enforceability of contracts.

Proper Offer and Acceptance: There must be at least two parties- one making the offer and the a<br>other accepting it. Such offer and acceptance must be valid. An offer to be valid must fulfill certain s e conditions, such as it must intend to create legal relations, its terms must be certain and s<br>unambiguous, it must be communicated to the person to wghom it is made, etc. An acceptance to be i<br>valid must fulfill certain conaditions, such as it must bee absolute and unqualified, it must be made in the prescribed manner nand it must be communicalted by an authorized person before the offer l<br>lapses. e o R C 2. Intention to Create Legal Relationship: The requirement of intention to create legal relations in contract Law is aimed at sifting ouwt cases which are not really appropriate for court action. Not every agreement leads to a binding contract which can be enforced through the courts. For example you a<br>may have an agreed to take a friend for a movie or for dinner. You may have a moral duty to honour L<br>that agreement but not a legal duty to do so. This is because in general the parties to such agreements do not intend to be legally bound and the Law seeks to mirror the party's wishes. In order to determine which agreements are legally binding and have an intention to create legal relations, the Law draws a distinction between social, moral, domestic and religious agreements and agreements made in a commercial context. There must be an intention among the parties to create a legal relationship. In case of social or domestic agreements, the usual presumption is that the parties do not intend to create legal relationship but in commercial or business agreements, the usual presumption is that the parties intend to create legal relationship unless otherwise agreed upon.<br>Example: X invited Y to a dinner Y accepted the invitation. It is a social agreement. If X fails to serve dinner to Y, Y cannot go to the courts of Law for enforcing the agreement. Similarly, if Y fails to attend the dinner, X cannot go to the courts of Law for enforcing the agreement.<br>RELEVANT CASES ON THIS POINT:<br>→ Rose & Frank Co. v. Crompton Bros. (1925)<br>→ Balfour v. Balfour (1919)<br>3. Capacity of Parties: As per the requirement of Sec. 10, the parties to an agreement must be competent to contract. In other words, they must be capable or competent to enter into a contract.<br>If either of the parties does not have the capacity to contract, the contract is not valid. According to Section 11 of Indian Contract Act, 1872, “Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the Law to which he is subject and who is of sound mind and is not 7</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td></td><td>All agreements are contract if they are made by the free consent of the</td></tr><tr><td>parties, competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object and are not</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>expressly declared to be void.</td><td></td></tr></table><br><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Along with the elements mentioned under Section 10 there are certain other basic elements of a</td></tr><tr><td>valid contract which may be mentioned as follows</td></tr></table><br><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Section 11</td><td>Every person is competent to contract who is of the age</td></tr><tr><td>of majority according to the law to which he is subject and who is of sound mind and is not</td><td></td></tr></table><br><hr><h3>Page 5</h3><p>Subject – Law of Contract-I disqualified from contracting by any Law to which he is subject.” Therefore, other way round,<br>following persons are incompetent to contract-<br>(a) Minors,<br>(b) Persons of unsound mind, and<br>(c) Persons disqualified by Law to which they are subject.<br>So, the person to be competent to contract must be major, must be of sound mind and must not be declared disqualified from contracting by any Law to which he is subject. If the parties to agreement are not competent to contract, then no valid contract comes into existence.<br>RELEVANT CASE: Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh (Landmark case on minor’s contract. Minor’s contract has been held as void ab initio.) e c<br>4. Lawful Consideration: An agreement must be supported by lawful consideration. Consideration n<br>means something in return. In the words of Pollock, "Consideration is the price for which the a<br>promise of another is bought." Consideration is known as quid pro-quo i.e. something in return.<br>s e Contract Act not only requires a consideration rather it prescribes for a lawful consideration. Now,<br>s what constitutes a lawful consideration has been explainedg under Section 23 of the Indian Contract i. Act, 1872, according to whicah, “The consideration is econsidered lawful unless it is forbidden by Law or is of such a nanture that if permitted woluld defeat the provisions of any Law, or is l<br>fraudulent or involeves or implies injury to thoe person or property of another or is immoral or is opposed to pub R lic policy.” C Example: A agrees to sell his carw to B for Rs.1,00,000. Here B’s promise to pay Rs.1,00,000 is the consideration for A’s promise to sell the car and A’s promise to sell the car is the consideration for a. B’s promise to pay Rs.1,00,000.<br>L 5. Lawful Object: The object of an agreement must be lawful. According to Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, “the object is considered lawful unless-<br>o it is forbidden by Law;<br>o it is of such nature that if permitted it would defeat the provision of any Law;<br>o it is fraudulent;<br>o it involves an injury to the person or property of any other;<br>o the court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy.”<br>Example: X, Y and Z enter into an agreement for the division among them of gains acquired or to be acquired by them by fraud. The agreement is void because its object is unlawful.<br>6. Free Consent: There must be free consent of the parties to the contact. Free consent of all the parties to a contract is one of the essential elements of a valid contract as per requirement of Section 10. The parties to a contract should have identity of minds. This is called consensus ad idem in English Law. Consent has been defined under Sec. 13 of the Contract Act as follows-<br>“Two or more person are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense” (consensus ad idem). It means that there is no contract if the parties have not agreed upon the same thing in the same sense.<br>Further, Contract Act requires not only consent but a free consent. According to Section 14, consent is said to be free when it is not caused by-<br>o Coercion, or 8</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td></td><td>s

On the basis of creation or formation-<br>1. Express Contracts: An express contract is one entered into by words which may be either spoken or written. Where the proposal and acceptance is made in words, it is an express contract.<br>Example 1: A says to B, “Will you buy my furniture for Rs. 50,000?” B says to A, “I am ready to buy your car for Rs. 50,000.” It is an express contract made orally.<br>Example 2: A writes a letter to B, I offer to sell my furniture to you for Rs. 50,000.” B send a letter to A, “I am ready to buy your furniture for Rs. 50,000.” It is an express contract made in writing.<br>2. Implied Contracts: Where the proposal or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, it is an implied contract. Implied contract can be inferred ferom the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties who made them.<br>c Example: A, a coolie in uniform picks up the baggage of B to carry it from railway platform to the n<br>taxi without being asked by B to do so and B allows it. In this case there is an implied offer by the a<br>coolie and an implied acceptance by the passenger. Now, there is an implied contract between s e the coolie and the passenger and the passenger is bound to pay for the services of the coolie.<br>s g<br>i 3. Quasi Contracts or constaructive contracts: It is coentract in which there is no intention on either side to make a contranct, but the Law imposes a conltract. In such a contract, rights and obligations l<br>arise not by any eagreement between the poarties but by operation of Law. Thus, a finder of lost goods is und R<br>er an obligation to find oCut the true owner and return the goods. Similarly, where certain goods are delivered to a wrong addressee, the addressee is under an obligation either to pay for them or return them. w a<br>4. E. Com. Contracts/Contracts over Internet: These contracts are entered into between the L<br>parties using internet. In electronic commerce, different parties/persons create network which are linked to other network through EDI (Electronic Data Inter-change). This helps in doing business transactions using electronic mode.<br>B. On the basis of validity or enforceability-<br>1. Valid Contract: An agreement enforceable at Law is a valid contract as per Sec. 2(h). An agreement becomes a contract when all the essentials of a valid contract as laid down in Section 10 are fulfilled.<br>2. Void Contract [Sec. 2(j)]: The term ‘Void contract’ is a contradiction in terms. But according to Section 2(j), “A contract which ceases to be enforceable by Law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable” In other words, a void contract is a contract which was valid and legally enforceable when entered into but which subsequently became void due to supervening or subsequent impossibility of performance, change of Law or some other reason.<br>3. Void Agreements: According to Section 2(g), "An agreement which is not enforceable by Law by either of the parties is void." Such agreements are void ab initio i.e. they are unenforceable from the very inception. No legal rights or obligations can arise out of a void agreement. For example an agreement without consideration or with a minor is a void agreement. A void agreement never matures into a contract.<br>10</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Valid Contract</td><td>An agreement enforceable at law is a valid contract as per Sec. 2(h).

Voidable Contract: According to Section 2(i), "An agreement which is enforceable by Law at the option of one or more of the parties thereto but not at the option of the other or others is a voidable contract." Note that the word used here is 'contract' and not just 'agreement'. This is the result of absence of free consent in the contract. The consent is said to be not free when it was obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. The other party who although took a consent cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own fraud because this is a judicial principle that "He who comes into equity (i.e. before Law) must come with clean hands." Thus, a voidable contract is one which can be set aside or repudiated or avoided at the option of that aggrieved party whose consent was not free. Also, a voidable contract is valid and enforceable until it is repudiated (i.e. avoided) by the party entitled to avoid it.<br>[NOTE: As per Section 64 of the Contract Act, in case of a voiedable contract, if the aggrieved party decides to repudiate the contract, the party rescinding the contract must restore the benefit received by him c<br>under the contract to the person from whom the benefit was received and the other party is freed from n<br>his oligation to perform the contract. This is called “RESTITUTION”]<br>a s e 5. Unenforceable Contract: It is contract which is otherwise valid, but cannot be enforced because s<br>of some technical defects like absence of a written fogrm or absence of a proper stamp. Such i<br>contracts cannot be provaed in court. But, such conetracts can be enforced if the technical defect involved is removed.n l l. Example: An orael agreement for arbitratioon is unenforceable because the Law requires that an arbitration R<br>agreement must be in wrCiting. If the oral agreement for arbitration is reduced to writing, it will become enforceable.<br>w 6. Illegal Agreements: An illegal agreement is one the object of which is unlawful, or is prohibited a<br>by Law or otherwise against the policy of Law. Such agreements cannot be enforced by Law. Illegal L<br>agreements are always void ab initio. Thus, a contract to commit dacoity is an illegal agreement and cannot be enforced at Law.<br>→ EFFECT ON COLLATERAL AGREEMENT: In case of illegal agreements, even the collateral agreements become void. Although an illegal agreement should be distinguished from a void contract. All illegal agreements are void but all void agreements or contracts are not necessarily illegal. Every void agreement is not illegal unless its object or consideration is immoral, or opposed to public policy etc. A void contract does not affect collateral or a parallel contract.<br>C. On the basis of execution or performance-<br>1. Executed contracts: An executed contract is one where both the parties have performed their respective obligations under the contract and nothing remains to be done by either party.<br>Example: A offers to sell his bike to B for Rs. 15,000. B accepts A’s offer. A delivers his bike to B and B pays Rs. 15,000 to A. It is an executed contract.<br>2. Executory Contract: Where the contract is yet to be performed either wholly or partially or one or both parties have yet to perform their obligation, the contract is executory contract.<br>Example: A offers to sell his bike to B for Rs. 15,000. B accepts A’s offer. If the bike has not yet been delivered by A and the price has not yet been paid by B, it is an executory contract.<br>3. Partly Executed and Partly Executory Contract: It is a contract where one of the parties to the contract has fulfilled his obligation and the other party has still to perform his obligation.<br>11</p><table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='4'><tr><td>Voidable Contract</td><td>According to</td><td>Section 2(i)</td><td>, &quot;</td><td>An agreement which is enforceable by law at</td></tr><tr><td>the option of one or more of the parties thereto but not at the option of the other or others is</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>a voidable contract</td><td>.&quot; Note that the word used here is &#x27;contract&#x27; and not just &#x27;agreement&#x27;.
