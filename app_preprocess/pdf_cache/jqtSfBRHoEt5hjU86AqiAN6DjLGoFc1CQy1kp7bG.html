II SEM. Subject – English Unit – I INTRODUCTION Legal language refers to the specialized and formalized language used in the field of Law,<br>encompassing statutes, regulations, contracts, court opinions, and other legal documents. It is characterized by precision, technicality, and a specific structure to ensure clarity and accuracy in legal communication. Legal language serves as a tool for conveying legal concepts, rights,<br>obligations, and procedures in a way that minimizes ambiguity and leaves little room for interpretation.<br>INTRODUCTION Legal language is a unique form of communication designed to address the complexities of the legal system. It serves as the medium through which laws are expressed and understood, providing a framework for the application and enforcement of rules within a society. The use of legal language is essential for ensuring fairness, justice, and the protection of individual rights.<br>CHARACTERISTIC OF LEGAL LANGUAGE 1. **Precision and Specificity:**<br>Legal language is characterized by its precision and specificity. Each word and phrase is carefully chosen to convey a particular meaning, leaving little room for ambiguity. This precision is crucial in legal documents to prevent misunderstandings and ensure the accurate interpretation of laws.<br>2. **Formalized Structure:**<br>Legal language follows a formalized structure, often involving standardized formats for legal documents such as contracts, statutes, and court opinions. This structure helps legal professionals navigate and understand the content efficiently, fostering consistency and predictability in legal communication.<br>3. **Technicality and Jargon:**<br>3</p><hr><h3>Page 4</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Legal language incorporates technical terms and jargon specific to the legal field. These terms carry precise meanings within the legal context, contributing to the development of a specialized vocabulary that is understood by legal professionals. While this may pose a challenge for non-<br>experts, it serves the purpose of maintaining clarity and accuracy within the legal community.<br>4. **Lack of Ambiguity:**<br>Ambiguity is minimized in legal language to prevent misinterpretation and ensure that the intended meaning is clear and unambiguous. Courts often rely on the language used in legal documents to determine the parties' rights and obligations, emphasizing the importance of clarity in legal language.<br>5. **Contextual Interpretation:**<br>Legal language is subject to contextual interpretation, where the meaning of a term or provision is derived from its context within the overall legal framework. Courts may consider legislative intent,<br>precedent, and other contextual factors to interpret legal language accurately.<br>6. **Redundancy for Emphasis:**<br>Legal language may include redundant expressions to emphasize certain points or requirements.<br>Repetition serves to underscore critical elements, leaving no room for oversight or misinterpretation.<br>7. **Structural Formality:**<br>Legal documents follow a formalized structure, often involving sections, subsections, articles, and clauses. This structural formality assists in organizing information logically and allows for easy reference and navigation.<br>8. **Prescriptive Nature:**<br>Legal language is often prescriptive, outlining rights, duties, and obligations in a straightforward manner. Legal documents may use imperative language to convey commands, obligations, or prohibitions.<br>4</p><hr><h3>Page 5</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English 9. **Use of Double Negatives:**<br>Legal language may employ double negatives to express prohibitions or limitations. For example,<br>"shall not be unenforceable" is a common construction to emphasize the validity of a provision.<br>10. **Contextual Interpretation:**<br>Legal language is subject to contextual interpretation. The meaning of a term or provision may be derived from its context within the overall legal framework, including legislative intent, case Law,<br>and precedent.<br>CONCLUSION These characteristics collectively contribute to the unique nature of legal language, ensuring that legal documents effectively communicate complex concepts while maintaining clarity and minimizing the potential for misinterpretation. In summary, legal language is a specialized form of communication with distinct characteristics such as precision, formalized structure, technicality, and a focus on minimizing ambiguity. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the effective expression and understanding of legal concepts, rights, and obligations within the legal system.<br>HISTORY OF LEGAL LANGUAGE WITH SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:<br>1. **Ancient Legal Systems:**<br>In ancient Mesopotamia, the Code of Ur-Nammu (circa 2100-2050 BCE) is one of the earliest known legal codes. Written in cuneiform on clay tablets, it prescribed punishments for various offenses, such as theft or murder. The language used was formal and structured, reflecting the gravity of the legal pronouncements.<br>2. **Roman Law and Latin Influence:**<br>The Roman legal system produced influential works like the "Institutes" by Gaius and "Digest" by Justinian. Latin phrases such as "actus reus" (guilty act) and "mens rea" (guilty mind) are still used in contemporary legal discussions, showcasing the enduring influence of Roman legal language.<br>5</p><hr><h3>Page 6</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English 3. **Medieval Legal Latin:**<br>Legal documents like the Magna Carta (1215) were written in Latin. For example, Clause 39 of the Magna Carta, written in Latin, declared: "Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur... nisi per legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem terrae" (No free man shall be seized or imprisoned...<br>except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the Law of the land).<br>4. **Common Law and Case Law:**<br>In the medieval period, legal language in England was shaped by decisions like those in the Year Books. For instance, in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932), a landmark case in the development of the Law of negligence, the language used in the judgment contributed to the evolution of legal principles.<br>5. **Rise of Legal Treatises:**<br>During the Renaissance, legal treatises like Sir Edward Coke's "Institutes of the Lawes of England" (1628) were written in English. These works aimed to explain legal concepts to a broader audience, contributing to the democratization of legal knowledge.<br>6. **Legal Latin Persistence:**<br>Even into the 18th century, Latin phrases were commonly used in legal documents. For instance,<br>"habeas corpus" (you shall have the body) remains a fundamental legal concept ensuring the right to personal liberty.<br>7. **Codification and Modernization:**<br>In the 19th century, legal codes such as the Napoleonic Code (1804) exemplified efforts to systematize laws. These codes were written in plain language and aimed to provide clear and accessible rules for citizens.<br>8. **Specialization of Legal Language:**<br>6</p><hr><h3>Page 7</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English In the 20th century, the development of specialized legal terminology became evident. In intellectual property Law, terms like "patent infringement" and "copyright infringement" emerged,<br>reflecting the need for precision in specific legal domains.<br>9. **Contemporary Legal Language:**<br>In the present day, legal language persists in legal documents such as contracts, statutes, and court opinions. For instance, the language used in landmark Supreme Court decisions, like Roe v. Wade<br>(1973), continues to shape legal discourse in areas like reproductive rights.<br>The history of legal language showcases a dynamic evolution from ancient codes to contemporary legal documents, reflecting changes in language, culture, and legal philosophy over time. Examples from various periods illustrate the ongoing influence of historical legal language on the present-day legal landscape.<br>Legal Language in India: A Pillar of Justice and Governance Legal language is a cornerstone of any legal system, providing the framework for the creation,<br>interpretation, and application of laws. In the context of India, a diverse and dynamic nation with a rich legal heritage, the importance of legal language cannot be overstated. It plays a pivotal role in shaping the country's legal landscape, contributing to the administration of justice, the formulation of laws, and the protection of individual rights.<br>India's legal system is a blend of various influences, including ancient legal traditions, colonial legacies, and contemporary legislative developments. The use of legal language in India reflects this intricate tapestry, encompassing a mix of Sanskrit, Persian, English, and vernacular languages. The multilingual character of legal language in India reflects the nation's linguistic diversity and the need to cater to a vast and heterogeneous population.<br>One of the primary functions of legal language in India is the codification of laws. The Constitution of India, adopted in 1950, serves as the supreme legal document and is drafted in both English and Hindi. It outlines the fundamental rights and duties of citizens, the structure of government, and the principles guiding the nation. The precision and clarity of legal language in the Constitution lay the foundation for the Indian legal system.<br>The importance of legal language in India is evident in the drafting of legislation. The Indian Parliament enacts laws covering a wide array of subjects, ranging from criminal justice to economic regulation. Legal language ensures that statutes are formulated with precision, leaving little room 7</p><hr><h3>Page 8</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English for ambiguity or misinterpretation. The drafting process involves legal experts who meticulously choose words to capture the intended legal effect, balancing the intricacies of the Law with the need for clarity.<br>In the administration of justice, legal language plays a crucial role in both the judiciary and legal practice. Courts across India deliver judgments and opinions in a formalized and structured language, relying on legal precedents and statutory interpretation. Legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and advocates, are adept in the use of legal language to present arguments, analyze cases, and communicate effectively within the legal framework.<br>Judicial decisions in India often involve the interpretation of legal texts, statutes, and constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court and High Courts, as well as lower courts, engage in a process where legal language serves as the medium for conveying legal reasoning and principles. Landmark cases,<br>such as Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), have shaped the interpretation of the Constitution, and the language used in these judgments establishes legal precedents for future cases.<br>Legal language is not confined to courtrooms and legislative chambers; it permeates various aspects of public life. Contracts and agreements, whether entered into by individuals or corporations, rely on legal language to delineate rights, obligations, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The meticulous choice of words in legal documents ensures that parties understand their contractual commitments, fostering trust and fairness in transactions.<br>The importance of legal language extends beyond domestic boundaries to India's engagement in international relations. Treaties, agreements, and conventions entered into by India with other nations demand precise legal language to outline commitments, rights, and obligations.<br>International legal language facilitates diplomacy and ensures that the country adheres to its global responsibilities in a coherent and legally binding manner.<br>In legal education, the study of legal language is an integral part of Law school curricula. Aspiring lawyers are trained to navigate the intricacies of legal terminology, enhancing their ability to understand and apply the Law. The development of legal language skills equips future legal professionals with the tools needed to communicate effectively within the legal system.<br>While the use of legal language is indispensable for the proper functioning of the legal system in India, there are ongoing efforts to make legal texts more accessible to the general population. Legal literacy programs aim to bridge the gap between the complex language of the Law and the understanding of common citizens, empowering them to be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities.<br>In conclusion, legal language in India serves as a linchpin for justice, governance, and the protection of individual rights. Its role in codifying laws, facilitating the administration of justice,<br>8</p><hr><h3>Page 9</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English drafting legislation, and shaping international relations underscores its significance. As India continues to evolve, the nuanced and precise language of the Law remains instrumental in upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and the rule of Law.<br>Legal English is the type of English used in legal writing. In general, a legal language is a formalized language based on logic rules that differs from the ordinary natural language in vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and semantics, as well as other linguistic features aimed at achieving consistency, validity, completeness, and soundness while keeping the benefits of a human-like language such as intuitive execution, complete meaning, and open upgrade. However, legal English has been referred to as a "sublanguage" as it differs from ordinary English. A specialized use of certain terms and linguistic patterns governs the teaching of legal language. Thus, "we study legal language as a kind of second language, a specialized use of vocabulary, phrases, and syntax that helps us to communicate more easily with each other."<br>The term legalese, on the other hand, is a term associated with a traditional style of legal writing that is part of this specialized discourse of lawyers: communication that "lay readers cannot readily comprehend." This term describes legal writing that may be cluttered, wordy, indirect, and may include unnecessary technical words or phrases. Historically, legalese is language a lawyer might use in drafting a contract or a pleading but would not use in ordinary conversation. For this reason,<br>the traditional style of legal writing has been labeled reader-unfriendly. Proponents of plain English/plain language argue that legal "writing style should not vary from task to task or audience to audience... whatever lawyers write must be clear, correct, concise, and complete." These four Cs describe "characteristics of good legal writing style" in the United States.<br>There are different kinds (genres) of legal writing: for example, academic legal writing as in Law journals, juridical legal writing as in court judgments, or legislative legal writing as in laws,<br>regulations, contracts, and treaties. Another variety is the language used by lawyers to communicate with clients, requiring a more "reader-friendly" style of written communication than that used with Law professionals.<br>For lawyers operating internationally, communicating with clients and other professionals across cultures requires a need for transnational legal awareness and transcultural linguistic awareness.<br>Whatever the form of legal writing, legal and language skills form a vital part of higher education and professional training.<br>Legal English has particular relevance when applied to legal writing and the drafting of written material, including:<br>→ legal documents: contracts, licenses, etc.<br>→ court pleadings: summonses, briefs, judgments, etc.<br>→ laws: acts of parliament and subordinate legislative acts, case reports 9</p><hr><h3>Page 10</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English<br>→ legal correspondence: cease and desist letters Legal English has traditionally been the preserve of lawyers from English-speaking countries (especially the U.S., the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, and South Africa), which have shared common Law traditions. However, due to the spread of legal English as the predominant language of international business as well as its role as a legal language within the European Union, legal English is now a global phenomenon.<br>Historical development In prehistoric Britain, traditional common Law was discussed in the vernacular (see Celtic Law). The legal language and legal tradition changed with waves of conquerors over the following centuries. Roman Britain (after the conquest beginning in AD 43) followed Roman legal tradition,<br>and its legal language was Latin. Following the Roman departure from Britain circa 410 and the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, the dominant tradition was instead Anglo-Saxon Law, which was discussed in the Germanic vernacular (Old English) and written in Old English since circa 600,<br>beginning with the Law of Æthelberht. Following the Norman invasion of England in 1066, Anglo-<br>Norman French became the official language of legal proceedings in England for a period of nearly 300 years until the Pleading in English Act 1362 (and continued in minor use for another 300 years), while Medieval Latin was used for written records for over 650 years. Some English technical terms were retained, however (see Anglo-Saxon Law: Language and Dialect for details).<br>In legal pleadings, Anglo-Norman developed into Law French, from which many words in modern legal English are derived. These include property, estate, chattel, lease, executor, and tenant. The use of Law French during this period had an enduring influence on the general linguistic register of modern legal English. That use also accounts for some of the complex linguistic structures used in legal writing. In 1362, the Statute of Pleading was enacted, which stated that all legal proceedings should be conducted in English (but recorded in Latin). This marked the beginning of formal legal English; Law French continued to be used in some forms into the 17th century, although Law French became increasingly degenerate.<br>From 1066, Latin was the language of formal records and statutes and was replaced by English in the Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730. However, because only the highly educated were fluent in Latin, it never became the language of legal pleading or debate. The influence of Latin can be seen in a number of words and phrases such as ad hoc, de facto, de jure, bona fide, inter alia,<br>and ultra vires, which remain in current use in legal writing (see Legal Latin).<br>In 2004, David Crystal proposed a stylistic influence on the English legal language. During the medieval period, lawyers used a mixture of Latin, French, and English. To avoid ambiguity,<br>lawyers often offered pairs of words from different languages. Sometimes there was little ambiguity to resolve, and the pairs merely gave greater emphasis, becoming a stylistic habit. This is a feature of legal style that continues to the present day. Examples of mixed-language doublets are "breaking and entering" (English/French), "fit and proper" (English/French), "lands and tenements"<br>10</p><hr><h3>Page 11</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English<br>(English/French), and "will and testament" (English/Latin). Examples of English-only doublets are<br>"let and hindrance" and "have and hold.".<br>Modern English vocabulary draws significantly from Germanic languages, French, and Latin, the latter most often by way of French. These vocabularies are used preferentially in different registers,<br>with words of French origin being more formal than those of Germanic origin and words of Latin origin being more formal than those of French origin. Thus, the extensive use of French and Latin words in legal English results in a relatively formal style.<br>Further, legal English is useful for its dramatic effect: for example, a subpoena compelling a witness to appear in court often ends with the archaic threat "Fail not, at your peril"; the "peril" is not described (being arrested and held in contempt of court), but the formality of the language tends to have a stronger effect on the recipient of the subpoena than a simple statement like "We can arrest you if you don't show up.".<br>11</p><hr><h3>Page 12</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

We have appealed to the Municipality, but there has not been any response on the issue so far.<br>As our appeals to their office have had no effect, we believe that perhaps a mention in the media would be of great help. Since the beginning of the last month, the roads in Cheran Nagar have been almost impassable. The surface is badly broken up by the heavy rains, and on a dark night, it is positively dangerous for vehicles to pass that way. Moreover, there are heaps of road metal on both sides of the road, which leave very little room in the middle. The residents of the area have been inconvenienced in this way for weeks.<br>The situation is becoming worse.

Subject – English Abstracting An abstract is a short account of the chief points of written matter, a book,<br>speech etc. It is a summary: like the precis, it reduces the length of a passage. But an abstract is more condensed than a precis. It is a very brief presentation of all the points made by the author of the original. The abstract of a 200 page book may be only 2 or 3 pages long. As far as possible the author's words are used and the presentation follows the order of the original. The abstract of books, articles,<br>scientific studies are very useful to research workers. So they read the abstracts first and decide whether they are related to their subjects and if they are related,<br>they go through the original ones. Historians, sociologists, psychologists,<br>doctors, advocates etc. have to read them for the same reason.<br>There is an important difference between a precis and an abstract. One reads an abstract when he is searching for material on his subject whereas one reads a precis because he is interested in the original but has no time to read it completely. However, there are, occasions when an abstract too serves the purpose of a precis. A busy company executive may ask his secretary to prepare the abstract of a long correspondence comprising correspondence of a big file.<br>The total information is often condensed into a short form.<br>In writing an abstract, you follow the same steps as in writing a precis. After preparing the outline with complete details, you draft the abstract from it BRIEF WRITING Writing or speaking about events in short time briefing, generally, relates to speaking for a short period. The subordinates brief their officers in nut shell orally about the events which happened in meetings or on their observations.

II SEM. Subject – English PRECISE WRITING Precise Writing<br>(Summarising or Briefing)<br>The French word precis (n)/prersi:/ (singular);/preisi:z/ (plural) means summary or abstract. The English word precise (adj.) /prisais/ means accurately expressed. 'Precise' has its Latin origin `praecido' which means cut short.<br>The synonyms of 'precise' are accurate, correct, definite, distinct, exact, explicit, express, nice,<br>pointed, severe, strict, unequivocal, well-defined, careful, scrupulous, ceremonious, financial,<br>formal, prim, punctilious, rigid, starched, stiff, specific (clarity), categorical.<br>Precis may be defined as "a concise and clear statement embodying in a connected and readable shape the substance of a longer passage." Precis is the art of expression of a passage in a shorter period of time so that the exact idea may be followed by the reader quickly. A precis is the gist or ma in theme of a passage exactly in a few words as possible.<br>Precis differs from a paraphrase. A paraphrase should reproduce not only the substance of a passage, but also all its details and there will be no shortening of the size of the passage and the paraphrase may be longer than the original passage, whereas precis must always be much shorter than the original. Though there is no rigid rule for the length of a precis, it should not contain more than a third of the number of words in the original passage Precis Writing: Precis writing is an integral part of various MBA exams & Bank, Government Exams like UPSC, SSC, NABARD, SEBI, SIDBI, SBI PO, etc. It tests your ability to read, understand and present text in a clear, crisp, and concise manner.<br>Steps to Write a Precis Step 1: Read the given passage carefully. Underline or highlight the important points and keywords or make a note of them (whichever is convenient). If you’re making a note of the important points, note them down in the same order as given in the original passage.<br>Step 2: After reading, make a note of the central theme/main idea/gist and the tone of the author of the passage.<br>Step 3: Re-read the article and compare it with your notes or check if you have missed underlining any crucial point.<br>Step 4: Provide your precis with an appropriate title (you can also do this after you finish writing your precis).<br>95</p><hr><h3>Page 96</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Step 5: Draft a precis based on the notes you have taken down or points you have underlined. Keep the following points in mind while writing your precis:<br>→ A Precis isn’t simply the abstract of the passage, nor is it a mere selection of important sentences of the passage. A Precis needs to convey the main idea of the original passage, including all the important points, the author’s facts, opinions, ideas, and thoughts, with absolute clarity, in the precis writer’s own words.<br>→ The main idea of the passage needs to be conveyed as accurately and as briefly as possible in the precis. Do not add long sentences or garrulous thoughts in your precis.<br>→ The precis should be written in the precis writer’s own words (no copy-pasting) and should include all the essential points and the gist of the original passage, so that, the reader will be able to understand the idea behind the original passage without having to go through it.<br>→ The language used to write precis should be clear, crisp & concise.<br>→ Include a statement that explains why the research was conducted (in case it’s research) or why the piece of writing was written (in case of an article)<br>→ Discard the non-essential parts of the original passage and do not include them in your precis.<br>→ Precis is always written in the third person and in a reported speech. Any history-related fact in a precis is to be written in the past tense.<br>→ A precis needs to be objective. It doesn’t offer evaluations or critical analysis. Hence, refrain from including your opinions, subjective interpretations, personal reactions, wishes, remarks, or criticisms in your precis.<br>→ Do not include abbreviations or contractions in your precis.<br>→ A Precis should make logical sense and follow the chronology of events in the same way as the original passage.<br>→ Officials mentioned in the precis need to be provided with designations instead of names or titles. In case the designation is missing, you can use their personal name.<br>→ There are no rigid rules to how lengthy your precis can be, but as a general rule, your precis should be not more than one-third of the total number of words in the original passage.<br>→ The precis needs to make logical sense and have the exact same logical structure, chronology,<br>proportions, order, ideas, facts, and thoughts as that of the original passage.<br>→ The precis needs to read smoothly. Precis is a connected whole. The precis reader needs to be able to sift from one point to another in a smooth manner.<br>Step 6: Review your precis. It’s important to review your precis to confirm that you have included all the essential points, supporting evidence, and the gist from the original passage and to ensure coherence, and correctness with respect to grammar and spelling, and clarity. Post-review, count the number of words of the precis and put them down in a bracket at the end.<br>A Good Precis Format | Precis Writing Samples with Answers Is Clear, Concise, Coherent, and Precise Is written in the precis writer’s own words 96</p><hr><h3>Page 97</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Contains all the essential points, the author’s tone, facts, opinions, thoughts, and the main idea of the original passage.<br>The Length of a Precis:<br>1. A precis must always be much shorter than the original passage. An ideal precis would not contain more than one-third of the number of words in the original text.<br>2. Generally, the number of words is given at the end of the paragraph. All you need to do is divide the number by three.<br>3. Be sure to count all the words in the paragraph. Some guides do not include the articles and prepositions in the count, while most do.<br>4. It is time-consuming to count the words in the time given for all segments in the descriptive paper in the exams, so an approximation would be okay until the summary is less than one-third of the original text.<br>Quick tip: You can count the words in one line and then multiply the count with the number of lines in the paragraph to get a fairly accurate number of words.<br>Approach for Precis Writing:<br>To write a good precis, read the passage given in question carefully. It is advisable to read the passage multiple times and thoroughly understand the paragraph. After you finished reading the passage, think of a suitable title for your precis. While you write a precis, follow a logical sequence of events as given in the original passage. Avoid phrases like “In my opinion”, “In my view” etc.<br>The precis should be written in past tense and indirect speech. Use easily understandable language.<br>Ask yourself questions like:<br>What is the basic theme of the passage?<br>Which are the most important points in the passage?<br>Which are the points that I can eliminate?<br>A good practice would be to make a rough note of these points.<br>97</p><hr><h3>Page 98</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

Its major food imports include wheat, sugar and fish. Another big import, rice, accounts for about US$1.65 billion. Most of the country’s rice is imported from Thailand and India. This has led analysts to predict it will be the world’s second-largest importer of rice after China in 2019.<br>There are a few reasons that Nigeria’s demand for rice is so high. Among them is rapid urbanisation;<br>people who arrive in cities and seek out cheap, nutritious, filling food invariably turn to rice. More traditional coarse grains like sorghum and millet have become less popular over the years. This,<br>according to research, is because rice is “a more convenient and easy staple to prepare compared to other traditional cereals across income levels in the urban areas”.<br>Now Nigeria’s government is trying to stem the tide of imported rice. Towards the end of 2018,<br>it announced its intention to halt rice imports entirely. In doing so, it hopes to save a great deal of money. But is this plan realistic? Unfortunately, it’s not. Nigeria’s agricultural sector simply isn’t equipped to produce the amount of rice to meet demand. It is battling natural and climatic factors, a lack of funding and training for farmers, and a dearth of government support. To turn this around,<br>the government needs to invest heavily in rice farmers.<br>Precis Writing Answer Nigeria and its Import of Rice There are reasons for the high demand for rice in Nigeria, which makes it to import $1.65 billion worth of rice out of a total $22 billion food imports each year and is predicted to become world’s second-largest importer of rice after China in 2019. Rapid urbanization, cheapness and nutritional value are some of the reasons for its high demand. The choice of rice is because of its convenience and easiness to prepare.<br>The Government is putting a blanket ban on rice imports as announced towards the end of 2018 in order to save money. But the plan is unrealistic by design since Nigeria’s agricultural sector is not prepared to meet its rice demand. On top of that, Nigeria is battling other factors too of natural and climatic nature, dearth of funding and farmers’ training. To solve these problems, the Government should invest in rice farmers aggressively.<br>98</p><hr><h3>Page 99</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Precis Writing Example 2 2.

Subject – English Unit – IV Legal Writing Fundamental principle of legal writing INTRODUCTION Good legal writing can play a very important role in winning cases but it is also hard work to be a good legal writer. To be effective, the sentences must be written clearly and persuasively(convincing) about complicated matters to readers. So like any other skills, good legal writing takes practice and a mastery of certain fundamentals. And the fundamental Principles which should be followed are given below –<br>1. Concision: It is minimizing words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating redundancy (unneeded words) without omitting important functions. It has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing. It means to be economical with words, expressing what is needed using the fewest words necessary that may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with the shorter ones.<br>It has also been described as ‘eliminating words that take up space without saying much’. In the construction of any sentence, the most important word is the verb. A verb should be short and precise. The subject should be identifiable from the context or introduction, and it should not need to be repeated every time it appears in a sentence.<br>Legal professionals use concision in order to make their legal arguments more persuasive and easier for courts and other lawyers to understand.<br>Moreover, it makes our work seem more professional and persuasive while saving our time which can end up being costly in the long run. Hence, it is one of the important fundamental principles of legal writing.<br>2. Clarity: It is the quality of being understandable. It is the quality of being expressed, remembered,<br>understood etc. in a very exact way. It is vital as any ambiguity in what is written has the potential to cause confusion.<br>3. Cogency: It is the quality or state of being convincing or persuasive. It only applies to inductive arguments. An argument is cogent if it is strong and the premises are true.<br>4. Simplicity: It is the quality of being simple. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. The quality or condition of being easy to understand i.e. the meaning should be clear and uncomplicated.<br>5. Note-Making: The Qualities of a good note is, it must be brief.<br>101</p><hr><h3>Page 102</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English METHODS OF LEGAL WRITING:<br>→ Cornell Method: This method is based on two columns i.e. the column of the left hand side will contain the keyboard/concept and the column on the right hand side will contain the description on notes, associated with the keyboard/concept.<br>→ Outlining Method: This method involves writing a series of topics and sub-topics and identifying them by indenting the text, numbering the lines or using a dash or bullet points.<br>→ Charting Method: This method involves a table of rows and columns with a top row generally containing the keyboard which clarifies the concept linked in the row table.<br>→ Sentence Method: This method involves the writing of a very new concept or topic on a separate line and the information can also be numbered if necessary.<br>THE CHARACTERISTICS/FEATURES OF PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL WRITING:<br>1. BRIEF WRITING Brief writing means written instructions by a lawyer or barrister representing a client in legal proceedings. In other words the brief means a summary of Law points prepared and written for the purpose of argument.<br>There is no definite rule for preparing and writing a brief of a case or matter. However, for writing an effective and impressive brief some tips may be given.<br>These are as follows:<br>→ It is one of the methods of composition. Therefore, a brief should be written in a clear and effective language.<br>→ A brief should be written point wise while maintaining the sequence of incidents.<br>→ A brief should be based on the facts as there is no scope of imagination and presumption.<br>→ Ordinarily, a brief should also be written in third person and past tense.<br>→ It is desirable to maintain the title of the matter in hand.<br>→ We should not write subscriptions like yours sincerely, faithfully, etc.<br>→ Before preparing and writing the brief of a case or matter one is suggested to read and underline the important sentences and Law points.<br>→ In support of the brief mention of annexure or page number in brackets at the end of the sentence.<br>→ At the end the name and signature of the person along with the date is necessary who writes the brief.<br>Generally a brief should be prepared and written in the sequence given below :<br>→ Facts of the case in summarized form;<br>→ Issues involved or framed;<br>102</p><hr><h3>Page 103</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English<br>→ Contentions (arguments) raised and case Law cited;<br>→ In case of judgment, the operative portion of the same.<br>2. CASE COMMENT In contrast(opposite) to a case outline, a case analysis is a specialized bit of lawful composing which digs profoundly into a few layers of the case. We are required to strip/Show these layers off to draw out the issues and break down to analysis of the cases in the light of those issues.<br>POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO WRITING A CASE COMMENT:<br>→ Law is not clear.<br>→ The judgment is correct and clears the Law.<br>→ The judgment was wrong.<br>→ The judgment was not wrong but the reasoning.<br>→ Important issue not discussed.<br>STEPS TO WRITE A CASE COMMENT:<br>INTRODUCTION: A case comment ideally begins with a short paragraph identifying the subject of the case so as to give the reader a fair idea regarding the issues we are going to address in the comment.<br>The subsequent section ought to be a short proclamation of facts expressing just the piece of the factual matrix which is fundamental to the issue being factually talked about.<br>BACKGROUND: The purpose of writing this section is to let the reader get the idea about the factual subject matter of the case before we can start our analysis. The absolute initiative step to do this is to draw a framework of the advancement of the Law paving the case under review by touching upon the landmark cases and significant statutory developments. This encourages the reader’s access to the court’s choice and understands the arguments in a simplified manner.<br>ANALYSIS: It is regarded as the main limb of the case comment. Here four relevant questions needed to be asked by yourself.<br>They are –<br>→ Was the Court’s decision right?<br>→ Is the decision the same/in the contrary to the existing Law? Was the reasoning similar or supplementary with the previous reasoning in the similar or relevant cases? Whether the decisions subsequently influence the existing Law?<br>→ Did the court justify its reasoning? Was the interpretation of the Law legitimate? Was the reasoning against/for? Did the court consider all issues or reject them? If there was omission, does it prove a demerit?<br>→ What are the policy implications of the decision? Are there any other sources which would lead to more appropriate public policy in this area?<br>103</p><hr><h3>Page 104</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English If you have answered all the questions then 80% of your job has been done. Your answer to these questions needs to be sustained by logical assertions and adequate reasoning.<br>CONCLUSION: The conclusion must contain the principle embodied by the creators or lawyer’s discoveries and interpretation. It’s not always necessary to arrive at the conclusion that the court’s decision was correct.<br>USING FOOTNOTES IN A CASE COMMENT: In case comment one must use an end-note based method of citation, as opposed to the textual citation you have used in briefs and memorandum. Your end-notes should be placed at the end of your comment, in a separate end-note section.<br>3. REPORT A report is an informational work containing information about certain events in a wide presentable form.<br>Reports are often conveyed in writing, speech, television or film. Reports may refer to specific periods,<br>events, occurrences or subjects and may be communicated or presented in oral or written form.<br>STAGES IN WRITING A REPORT:<br>All reports need to be clear, concise and well structured. The essential steps of writing a good report are as follows:<br>→ Understanding the purpose of the report.<br>→ Gathering and selecting relevant information.<br>→ Organizing the collected material<br>→ Analyzing the materials<br>→ Drafting of the report<br>→ Reviewing and redrafting<br>→ Presentation 4. Law REPORT A Law report is a record of judicial decision on a point of Law which sets a precedent. Law reports are of two kinds –<br>a. Full Text Law Report b. Summary Reports DRAFTING OF Law REPORTS:<br>An outline of a document is called drafting and one who drafts a document is called draftsman rather than designer. However, drafting of Law reports is another form of brief writing. But, in the field of legal profession a brief of the case is prepared and written with a view to prepare arguments of the case. Like brief writing, the drafting of Law reports should also be in concise pattern while giving complete details of the case decided by the Court.<br>Mostly, legal reporters of newspapers and magazines are engaged in drafting Law reports but it is expected that they are well familiar with legal terminology and moderate knowledge of Law.<br>104</p><hr><h3>Page 105</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, a former Law Member of the Government of India has said ‘the Law reports are not merely reprints of the written judgments of the judges’.<br>He was of the view that a Law reports should consist of –<br>1. Statement of facts of the case 2. Statement of the arguments of the advocates 3. Held/operative portion of the judgment He also opined (suggested) that Law reporting should be regarded as a branch of legislation needed attention of the Government.<br>CITING OF REPORTED CASES: In citing reported cases it is helpful to the court first to summarize the proposition of Law in support of which the case is cited, then to give distinctly and accurately the name of the case and its reference in the Law reports, giving the judge time to make a note of it and then to read such passages as bear upon the note as issue. Counsel (lawyer) owes a duty to the court to bring to its notice all the relevant authorities of which they are aware even though they may tell against their case.<br>5. LEGAL CITATION It is the practice of crediting and referring to authoritative documents and sources. A legal citation refers to a specific legal source such as constitution, a statute, reported cases, a regulation, a treatise or a Law review article. A legal citation needs to be used to support or refute (deny) an argument, to provide the legal basis of an argument and simply to indicate the source of the claim.<br>PURPOSE OF CITATION:<br>→ Identify the document and document part to which the writer is referring.<br>→ Provide the reader with sufficient information to find the document or the document part in the sources the reader has available (which may or may not be the same sources as those used by the writer).<br>→ Furnish important additional information about the referenced material and its connection to the writer’s argument to assist readers in deciding whether or not to pursue the reference.<br>WRITING A LEGAL CITATION:<br>There are primarily 6 components of Case Law –<br>1. The names of the parties involved in the suit: Traditionally, the names of the parties to a case are mentioned in italics. If there is more than one party on either side, cite only the first name listed. The omission may be indicated by the use of ‘& Ors’ meaning ‘and others’.<br>2. Year: This follows the year in which the parties have registered the case. It is enclosed in either round or square brackets.<br>3. The volume of the reporter containing the full text of the case: If there is volume number as a part of the Law report series, and then it must be indicated immediately after the year.<br>4. The abbreviated (short form) name of the case reporter: There are the standard forms of abbreviation of most Law report series.<br>105</p><hr><h3>Page 106</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English 5. The page number on which the case begins: Give the page number at which the case begins in the series of reports cited.<br>6. The name of the court deciding the case: The name of the Court pronouncing the judgment may or may not be there.<br>Moreover, the States with their unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guide, which includes information or citation rules.<br>It can be concluded as it helps in following a line of argument straight through many abbreviations and special terms embedded in it.<br>Cohesive Devices, Combination of sentences Pleadings are statements in writing drawn up and field by each party to a case, stating what his contentions will be at the trial and giving all such details as his opponent needs to know in order to prepare his case in answer.<br>The whole object of pleadings is to ascertain with precision the points on which the parties agree and those on which they differ and this they bring the parties to a definite issue, so that the parties may be saved from the expense and trouble of calling evidence which may prove unnecessary, and further that neither party may be taken by surprise.<br>The following are the requisites if a planning:<br>1. Every pleading must state facts and not Law.<br>2. It must state all the material facts and material facts only.<br>3. It must state only the facts on which the party pleading relies, and not het evidence by which they are to be proved.<br>4.

Avoid complex sentences – use short and simple sentences.<br>7. Avoid repetition 8. All unnecessary adverbs and adjectives and argumentative pleas must be avoided.<br>9. The legal effect of a document can be stated shortly without repeating its words.<br>The language used in the pleadings should be simple but without giving rise to emotion or sentiment. The facts asserted must be definitely stated.<br>107</p><hr><h3>Page 108</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM.

You are required to strip these layers off to draw out the issues and break down to analysis of the case in the light of those issues. You can do this by following four straightforward advances:-<br>1. Re-guessing the case keeping in the thoughts the issues that you will talk about in the Comment.<br>2. Understanding complex circumstances and distinguishing the lawful issues or lacunae for the situation;<br>3. Sieving out pertinent subtleties and pointers from the case that help your investigation.<br>4.

These are:<br>Introduction A case comment ought to in a perfect world start with a short passage recognising the subject of the case to give the peruser a reasonable thought in regards to the issues you are going to address in the remark.<br>The subsequent section ought to be a short proclamation of facts expressing just the piece of the factual matrix which is fundamental to the issue being talked about. From there on, you ought to compose the demeanour and what was in the end held in a case in an exact way.<br>Background The reason for composing this segment is to let the reader get the general thought regarding the genuine topic of the case before you start your analysis. The absolute initial step to do this is to draw a framework of the advancement of the Law paving the way to the case under 115</p><hr><h3>Page 116</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English review by addressing milestone cases and noteworthy legal turns of events. This encourages the reader to assess the court’s choice and comprehend your contentions all the more unmistakably.<br>Analysis This establishes the primary appendage of the case comment. Here you have to ask yourself four relevant questions1, to be specific-<br>1. Was the Court’s decision correct ?<br>2. Does this choice change/acclimate with existing Law? Was the reasoning consistent with past thinking in comparative cases? Is it likely that the choice will altogether impact existing Law?<br>3. Did the court legitimize its thinking?<br>Was its understanding of the Law suitable? Was the thinking legitimate/reliable?<br>Did the court think about all/preclude a few issues and contentions?<br>Also, if there was oversight, does this debilitate the value of the choice?<br>4. What are the strategy ramifications of the choice? Are there elective methodologies which could prompt increasingly fitting open approach around there?<br>On the off chance that you have responded to these inquiries agreeably, 80% of your activity is finished. As the sole reason for the case comment is to dismember a specific legal issue, you should be amazingly cautious here as to not address any incidental or fringe issue. Your response to these inquiries must be validated by sensible declarations and satisfactory thinking.<br>Conclusion The conclusion to the case comment ought to embody the principle embodiment of the creator’s discoveries and contentions. It isn’t generally important to arrive at a resolution to settle on whether the court’s decision was correct. You can basically end your analysis by quickly expressing the effect of the case and bringing up certain lacunae (assuming any).<br>Using Foot-notes in a Case Comment It is fitting that you utilize talking references to quickly detail or examine other pertinent data which may be helpful for the reader to know. Despite the fact that there is no standard concerning what number of footnotes ought to be there, you should maintain a strategic distance from inordinate footnoting keeping in with the general policy followed by the most reputed Law journals in the world. Also, however you are allowed to utilize any sort of uniform citation strategy, it is prudent that you utilize the Blue Book technique which is most ordinarily utilized for Law journals.<br>116</p><hr><h3>Page 117</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

State of Kerala Citation: AIR 1973 SC 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225 Subject:<br>This landmark judgment dealt with the extent of Parliament's amending power under Article 368 of the Indian Constitution and established the "Basic Structure Doctrine," ensuring that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered even by a constitutional amendment.<br>Facts of the Case:<br>1. Background:<br>Kesavananda Bharati, the head of Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act,<br>1969, which sought to impose restrictions on the Mutt's management of its property.<br>2. Legal Challenge:<br>Kesavananda Bharati filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, contending that the Act infringed on his fundamental rights, particularly Articles 25, 26, and 31 (right to property).<br>3. Conflict:<br>The case was heard in the context of two earlier judgments:<br>o Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967): Held that Parliament cannot amend Part III<br>(Fundamental Rights) of the Constitution.<br>o Shankari Prasad (1951) and Sajjan Singh (1965): Upheld the unlimited amending power of Parliament.<br>4. Constitutional Amendments in Question:<br>o 24th Amendment: Affirmed Parliament's power to amend any part of the Constitution,<br>including Fundamental Rights.<br>o 25th Amendment: Curtailed property rights and limited judicial review in socio-economic reforms.<br>Arguments by Parties:<br>Petitioner (Kesavananda Bharati):<br>1. The amendments, particularly the 24th and 25th Amendments, violated the essence of the Constitution.<br>2. Fundamental Rights are inviolable and form the core of the Constitution, which cannot be amended.<br>3. Judicial review is an integral feature of the Constitution and cannot be diluted.<br>117</p><hr><h3>Page 118</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Respondent (State of Kerala):<br>1. Parliament possesses unlimited amending power under Article 368, including the power to amend Fundamental Rights.<br>2. The amendments were enacted to implement Directive Principles of State Policy, which hold equal importance to Fundamental Rights.<br>3. The concept of "Basic Structure" is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution and cannot be a basis for limiting Parliament's power.<br>Judgment of the Supreme Court:<br>1. Bench Composition:<br>The case was heard by a 13-judge Constitution Bench, the largest ever in Indian judicial history.<br>2. Verdict:<br>The Court, by a 7:6 majority, held that:<br>o Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, under Article 368.<br>o However, this power is not unlimited. Amendments cannot alter or destroy the "basic structure" or essential features of the Constitution.<br>3. Validity of Amendments:<br>o The 24th Amendment was upheld as valid.<br>o The 25th Amendment was upheld with certain modifications, ensuring that judicial review remains intact.<br>Ratio Decidendi:<br>1. Basic Structure Doctrine:<br>The Constitution's fundamental principles—such as democracy, secularism, separation of powers,<br>and judicial review—cannot be abrogated or destroyed, even by constitutional amendment.<br>2. Balance Between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:<br>The Court emphasized the need to harmonize Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, ensuring socio-economic reforms do not infringe upon the Constitution's core ethos.<br>3. Judicial Review:<br>The judiciary retains the power to review amendments to determine whether they violate the Constitution's basic structure.<br>Significance:<br>118</p><hr><h3>Page 119</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

Judicial Independence:<br>By retaining judicial review, the judgment safeguarded the judiciary's role as the guardian of the Constitution.<br>3. Landmark Doctrine:<br>The Basic Structure Doctrine became a cornerstone of Indian constitutional Law, influencing subsequent judgments like Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980) and Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain<br>(1975).<br>Criticism:<br>1. Critics argue that the judgment imposes limitations on a democratically elected Parliament's ability to address socio-economic needs.<br>2. The doctrine is seen as vague, leading to subjective interpretations by the judiciary.<br>Conclusion:<br>The Kesavananda Bharati judgment is a monumental decision that preserved the sanctity of the Indian Constitution.

Dharmodas Ghosh Citation: (1903) 30 Cal 539 (Privy Council)<br>Subject:<br>This case addresses the issue of whether a contract entered into by a minor is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It established a significant principle of contract Law in India by declaring that contracts with minors are void ab initio.<br>Facts of the Case:<br>119</p><hr><h3>Page 120</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English 1. Background:<br>Dharmodas Ghosh, a minor at the time, mortgaged his property to a moneylender, Brahmo Dutt,<br>through his agent, for a loan of ₹20,000.<br>2. Legal Challenge:<br>Dharmodas Ghosh, through his mother (as his legal guardian), sued to have the mortgage deed declared void, arguing that he was a minor when the agreement was made and thus incapable of contracting under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.<br>3. Conflict:<br>The moneylender claimed that he was unaware of the minor’s age and sought enforcement of the mortgage deed or compensation for the loan advanced.<br>Arguments by Parties:<br>Plaintiff (Dharmodas Ghosh):<br>1. A contract with a minor is void under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, which states that only persons of the age of majority and sound mind can contract.<br>2. The mortgage deed was invalid as Dharmodas was a minor at the time of execution.<br>Defendant (Brahmo Dutt):<br>1. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had fraudulently misrepresented his age.<br>2. The defendant sought equitable relief, contending that if the contract were void, the minor should return the loan amount.<br>Judgment of the Privy Council:<br>1. Verdict:<br>The Privy Council ruled in favor of Dharmodas Ghosh, declaring the mortgage deed void ab initio.<br>2. Key Findings:<br>o Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act expressly prohibits minors from entering into contracts. Thus, any contract with a minor is void from the outset.<br>o No estoppel can arise against a minor based on misrepresentation of age.<br>o The doctrine of restitution (returning benefits received under a void agreement) does not apply when the contract itself is void ab initio.<br>120</p><hr><h3>Page 121</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Ratio Decidendi:<br>1. Incapacity of Minors:<br>Minors lack the legal capacity to contract under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act. Any agreement with a minor is void and unenforceable.<br>2. No Restitution:<br>When a contract is void due to incapacity, there is no obligation on the minor to return any benefit received under the void agreement.<br>3. No Estoppel:<br>A minor cannot be estopped from claiming minority status, even if they misrepresented their age at the time of entering into the contract.<br>Significance:<br>1. Legal Clarity on Minors' Contracts:<br>This judgment clarified the incapacity of minors to contract, providing a clear legal precedent for disputes involving minors.<br>2. Protection for Minors:<br>The decision ensures that minors are protected from exploitation by adults in contractual relationships.<br>3. Limitations on Equitable Relief:<br>The case highlighted that equitable relief, such as restitution, is not available when it conflicts with statutory provisions like Section 11.<br>Criticism:<br>1. The decision has been criticized for allowing minors to evade liability even in cases where they benefit from misrepresentation or fraud.<br>2. It creates challenges for parties dealing with minors, as they cannot enforce contracts or claim restitution.<br>Conclusion:<br>The Mohori Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh judgment is a landmark decision in Indian contract Law, emphasizing the protection of minors and strictly interpreting statutory provisions. While it ensures fairness towards minors, it also places a burden on adults to verify the capacity of contracting parties before entering into agreements. The case remains a cornerstone of contract Law and continues to guide courts in similar disputes.<br>121</p><hr><h3>Page 122</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English Structure of Law Essays and Law Reports Law Essays Unless you are told otherwise, the very minimum requirements of a Law essay or problem question are an introduction, a body and a conclusion.<br>→ Introduction: As a very rough guide, for essay style questions, the introduction will represent about 10% of your word count, outlining perhaps a brief interpretation of the question and what you intend to cover in the essay. For problem questions, the introduction will be fairly short and simple,<br>outlining for example the areas of Law and main statutes/cases that the question is concerned with.<br>→ Body:The body of your answer, accounting for the majority of the word count, should demonstrate your understanding of the area and develop your argument. It is a good idea here to keep referring explicitly to the question asked.<br>→ Conclusion: The conclusion for essay style questions will represent about 10 – 15% of your word count. This must summarise your main findings and points, and usually will reach a conclusion and answer the question set, which must be consistent with your findings and arguments in the body of the essay. You should never introduce new points or material in the conclusion. For problem questions, the length of your conclusion will depend on how you have approached the question. If you have reached conclusions in the body of your answer, there is little point repeating them here and you may just end up summarising your findings, e.g. “in conclusion, Jessie has a binding contract with Eve and will be bound by its terms, as agreed between the parties on the 18th of June”<br>etc.<br>Some Legal Essay Topics 1.

A report will be a neutral presentation, often dealing with the current Law, proposals for change and whether those proposals have been approved by leading bodies and interested parties. A report will also often consider alternatives to proposed change. A good structure for a Law report would be as follows:<br>→ Title Page: showing the title of the report, the author, the person for whom the report is prepared,<br>and the date of completion<br>→ Summary/Synopsis/Executive Summary: (approx 10% of word count) – this will identify: The purpose of the report, The scope of the report – issues covered/not covered, The important results and findings, The conclusions and recommendations, Acknowledgement of any assistance in researching and compiling the report’<br>→ Table of contents: not including the title and contents page!<br>→ Body of report: this will include: Introduction – what is the report about, Discussion – divided into sections and sub sections, presented clearly and confined to fact rather than analysis/opinion.<br>→ Conclusion: this should: Relate back to the findings in the body of the report, Include a clear summary of the main points, Outline the findings of the research. There should be nothing in the conclusion that has not already been mentioned in the body of the report.<br>→ Recommendations – these should:<br>1.

After all, nearly everyone speaks English in this day and age. What needs to be said or written can be done in English and Google Translate can solve all the rest. But is it really that simple?<br>Language is so much more than just a tool allowing us to communicate. It is the expression of culture,<br>society, and beliefs. Thousands of cultures exist around the world, all expressing the specifics of their daily lives through their own languages. Imagine the vast cultural treasures lost if they suddenly ditched their native tongues and simply communicated in one universal language.<br>Simultaneously, other languages may be incapable of expressing certain feelings, emotions, or specific descriptions.<br>A classic example is the German “Schadenfreude”, which means the joy and pleasure that come from witnessing the pain of others. An elegant word that easily expresses a specific phenomenon, but a similar expression does not exist in English dictionaries. In this regard, German might seem to be the richer language.<br>The meaning and purpose of translation But how can you learn about these phenomena? How can you learn about various cultures and begin to see the world through their eyes? Surely you cannot be expected to learn every language. There must be an easier way.<br>Enter translation.<br>Translation is more than just changing the words from one language to another. Translation builds bridges between cultures. It allows you to experience cultural phenomena that would otherwise be too foreign and remote to grasp through your own cultural lens.<br>However, skilful translators are required to build these bridges. Translators are people who have a near-<br>perfect understanding of both the source language and culture and the target language and culture. They know precisely how to grasp that “Schadenfreude” and bridge it over to you. They may use a few more words, or perhaps even change the wording of a whole paragraph, but the meaning of the original will get 124</p><hr><h3>Page 125</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English through. Then, you can begin to understand foreign concepts that have been bridged over to your native tongue.<br>The importance of the native tongue The native tongue is the language you understand best. You established it in the early stages of your life.<br>You express every emotion, feeling, and concept best in your native tongue as compared to any other language. No matter how perfect your other language skills become, there will never be a language you understand better than the one you’ve known the longest.<br>Therefore, receiving information in this language is essential, as it helps you avoid miscommunications. And this is precisely what translation does for you.<br>The importance of translation in literature A girl in Japan can easily enter a library, choose one of Tolstoy’s books and enjoy the world that he has created. Similarly, someone in Indonesia can find Wordsworth and get lost in the beauty of the English Lake District. All of this is possible thanks to translation. The very existence of world literature stands upon translation.<br>Classics and masterpieces can be enjoyed by people around the world. But, perhaps it is even more important that translation helps preserve literature. While the language might not be widespread, translation offers the works a much larger audience for many years to come.<br>The importance of translation in media At the end of a hard day, we love watching our favourite TV series. Translation’s got our backs here, as well.<br>We are not limited to one country’s productions. If the series isn’t dubbed, there are almost always subtitles (which are often even preferred).<br>And what about that latest Korean blockbuster you watched in the cinema? Without translation it would remain in Korea, and we could only wonder how great it might have been.<br>The importance of translation in journalism Spreading of information today depends on translation. It allows us to discover what’s happening in different countries through our own language, thereby staying informed about the world. Otherwise, we would simply live in an echo chamber, never confronting any different opinions.<br>Ignorance is indeed dangerous. But translation opens up millions of new sources. It grants access to a variety of worldviews and allows us to learn expert opinions from countries and cultures other than our own.<br>Moreover, it supports critical thinking and encourages us to listen to what others have to say.<br>The importance of translation in education The availability of so much information of course ties into education as well. Children can receive richer and more comprehensive knowledge from around the world, and they can learn to compare and discuss different perspectives.<br>125</p><hr><h3>Page 126</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.) II SEM. Subject – English In countries with many foreign-language-speaking children (caused by immigration, for example) translation can help with integration. Imagine living in a new country. You don’t understand the language—even your parents don’t. If all of your schoolbooks are translated into your native tongue, surely you can better adjust to your new surroundings.<br>Sometimes schools provide these children with individual educational interpreters. These people are specially trained, understand the child’s learning needs and communicate between the family and the school’s administration. This provides an invaluable help to ensuring a more secure future for the child.<br>However, when it comes to language learning, translation has fallen out of fashion. And no wonder: when you’re learning a new language, you want to communicate, not get stuck converting every word into your native language.<br>But translation remains a useful language skill to add to your toolbox. Just imagine all of the times you’ve had to translate a menu, interpret a train-schedule or be the mediator for your grandparents trying to order museum tickets abroad.<br>The importance of translation in business Of course, we can’t forget the economic sector. Without translation, business as we know it would not exist. Translation undoubtedly fuels the global economy. Every single business giant has one thing in common: a heavy reliance on foreign relations. These bring in many advantages, such as:<br>→ lower manufacturing costs,<br>→ professionals otherwise unavailable in the home country<br>→ and more markets to invest in.<br>This means that millions of project documentations, trade agreements, contracts or just simple manuals need translating. Furthermore, many meetings and audits need to be interpreted. All of which requires high-quality translation and interpreting professionals.<br>Abandon: परित्यक्त/ परित्याग किना<br>Abandonment: परित्याग Abandoned child: परित्यक्त शििु<br>Abandonee : परित्यक्क्त ( परित्यक्त होने वाला)<br>Abandoner: परित्यागी (परित्याग किने वाला)<br>Abdicable: अधित्याज्य Abate : उपिमन किना<br>Abatement : उपिमन Abatement of rent : भाटक का उपिमन किना<br>126</p><hr><h3>Page 127</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, and the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 were all enacted at this time as part of the Hindu Code Bills. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was passed to protect the legal rights of Hindu brides and grooms who are tied with the holy bond of marriage. Law has not specified which kind of marriage ceremony will be because there are numerous methods by which a man and woman can be wed in accordance with Hindu tradition. The Act of 1955 is divided into six Chapters, consisting of 29 Sections in total. The Act’s principal goal was to update and codify the Law that regulates the marriage between Hindus. It includes divorce and separation, both of which are already covered by Shastrik Law (old Hindu Law), in addition such Law has been revised and codified.<br>The Law became uniform for all Hindu groups as a result of this enactment.<br>138</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Testimony: गवाही</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Tort: अत्याचाि</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Trial: पिीिण</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Unconstitutional: संवैिाननक असंगनत</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Verdict: फैसला</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Victim: पीडडत</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Warrant: वािंट</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Witness: सािी</td></tr></table><br><hr><h3>Page 139</h3><p>Class –B.A.LL.B (HONS.)

Poverty is a malediction for our society. If you really want to realize what poverty is, then you must interact with people who live in slums. Talk to them, ask them about their lives, their past and then see how difficult their lives have been. I lived a middle class life and always got almost everything that I wanted, even though I had to ask my dad for many a time. I firmly believe that pain ideally is realized by the one who goes through, not by everybody. Indian Government has put in several efforts to improvise their lives, Huge is the number of NGOs, which claim to help the needy but implementation is not up to the mark and the major reasons of Government’s failure is nothing but the corruption. In fact, poverty and corruption go hand by hand. Both are mutually related to a great extent. If you are poor, you tend to do anything and everything that can get you some money and that’s where corruption comes from. However, there are numerous examples, where even the rich are corrupt due to the greediness for having more money.<br>गरीबी हमारे समाज के ललए एक अलभशाप है, अगर िास्ति में गरीबी को महसूस करना चाहते हो, तो आपको<br>उन लोगों से लमलना चादहए जो गन्िी बस्ती में रहते हैं। उनसे बात करो, उन्हें पूछो उनके जीिन के बारे में,<br>उनके बीते कल के बारे में और कफर िेखो उनकी श्ज़न्िगी ककतनी मुश्ककल रही है। मैंने एक मध्यम स्तर की<br>श्ज़न्िगी जी और लगभग िो हर चीज़ पायी जो मनै े चाही, हालााँकक मुझे अपने वपता से कई बार कहना पडा।<br>म ैं ये विकिास करता हूाँ कक ििय सही मायनों में िही महसूस करता है, जो उसस े गुजरता है, हर कोई नहीीं।<br>भारत सरकार ने उनके जीिन सुधार हेतु कई प्रयास ककये हैं, कई सारे गैर सरकारी सींस्थान (NGO) हैं जो<br>ज़रुरतमींिो की मिि करने का िािा करते हैं पर िास्तविकता कुछ और है और सरकार की असफलता का<br>140</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'>To some extent, he is right; But not quite/completely.

This festival is celebrated with joy and happiness. It is a festival of light. The reason of celebrating this festival is that on this day,<br>Lord Rama had come back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. On his arrival, people of Ayodhya lighted the whole city with Diyas. Since then, Hindus has been celebrating this festival. It is celebrated with fireworks and crackers. In this festival, distributing sweets has also become a trend. But there is something that we can’t ignore that on this day, air pollution is on high due to the smoke of crackers.<br>8. Criminals are those who commit crime for any reason at all. This is the actual definition that we expect from all of us and also we expect such people to be given the title ‘criminals’. However, needless to say that this title is not in fact given to all,<br>who commit crimes and neither, all the people, who are given this title are necessarily criminals. What we often hear is about hidden crimes, which are never unearthed; reasons are many.
