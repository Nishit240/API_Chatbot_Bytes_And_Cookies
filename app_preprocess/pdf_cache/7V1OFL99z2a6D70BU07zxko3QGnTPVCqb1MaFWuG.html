Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for 15 to 24 year olds.<br>It has been observed that the teens between childhood and adulthood are under great confusion and anxiety. Because at such juncture of age they undergo tremendous pressure to fit in society, to perform academically, and to act responsibly. Despite these factors there is the awakening of sexual feelings, a growing self-identity, and a need for autonomy that often conflicts with the rules and expectations set by others.<br>A teen with an adequate support network of family, friends, religious affiliations, peer groups, or extracurricular activities may have an outlet to deal with every day frustrations. But many teens do not believe they have that and feel disconnected and isolated from family and friends. These teens are at increased risk for suicide.<br>Factors that increase the risk of suicide among teens include:-<br>→ A psychological disorder, spatially depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol and drug use.<br>→ Feeling of distress, irritability, or agitation<br>→ Feeling of hopelessness and worthlessness that often accompany depression ( repeated failures at school)<br>→ A previous suicide attempt<br>→ A family history of depression or suicide (genetic component)<br>→ Physical or sexual abuse<br>→ Lack of a support network, poor relationship with parents or peers, and feelings of social isolation<br>→ Dealing with homosexuality in an unsupportive family or community or hostile school environment Child suicide in India It is seen that childhood today is no longer a joyful experience; instead lives of children and young adults are full of stress, tension, and apprehension.
