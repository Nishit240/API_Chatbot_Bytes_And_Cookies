Nature of Indian Constitution 3. Characteristics of federalism 4. Unitary form of Government INTRODUCTION A Constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a State or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution. Constitution was written by a committee headed by Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar. It took 2 yrs, 11 months, 18 days for compilation. It was adopted on 26th November, 1949 (celebrated as Law Day), and enforced fully on 26th January, 1950 (celebrated as Republic Day).<br>The Constitution of India is the longest written Constitution of any sovereign country in the world,<br>containing 444 Articles in 22 Parts, 12 Schedules while the United States Constitution is the shortest written Constitution, at 7 Articles. At the time of commencement, the Constitution had 395 Articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules.<br>→ Constitution is said to be the supreme Law of the land.<br>→ The drafting of the document called the Constitution was pursued by an assembly of elected representatives called the Drafting Committee, which was chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.<br>→ The above-said Committee prepared the draft of the Constitution. Then, several rounds of discussions took place. More than two thousand amendments were considered.<br>→ Every document presented and every word spoken in the Constituent Assembly has been recorded and preserved under the name of Constituent Assembly Debates.<br>SOURCES OF CONSTITUTION SOURCE PROVISION Parliamentary government, Rule of Law, legislative procedure, single BRITISH CONSTITUTION citizenship, cabinet system, citizenship, prerogative writs,<br>parliamentary privileges and bicameralism.<br>1</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'></td><td style='padding:6px'>UNIT-I : INTRODUCTION 1.

I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Preamble means a preliminary or introductory statement, especially attached to a statute or constitution setting forth its purpose. Preamble is an expressionary statement in a document that explains the document's purpose and underlying philosophy. When applied to the opening paragraphs of a statute, it may recite historical facts pertinent to the subject of the statute. The preamble to the Constitution of India is a brief introductory statement that sets out the guiding purpose and principles of the document.<br>In re BeruBari’s case1, it was held that the preamble is not an integral part of the Indian Constitution & therefore it can neither be regarded as a source of limitations or substantive powers nor it is enforceable in a court of Law. However, Supreme Court of India has, in the Keshavananda Bharti Case2, overruled earlier decisions and recognised that the preamble may be used to interpret ambiguous areas of the constitution where differing interpretations present themselves.<br>Forty-second Amendment, 1976: As originally enacted the preamble described the state as a<br>"sovereign democratic republic". In 1976 the Forty-second Amendment changed this to read<br>"sovereign socialist secular democratic republic." Also through this amendment, the phrase "unity of the Nation" was changed to "unity and integrity of the Nation".<br>PURPOSE OF PREAMBLE Preamble basically is a declaration of-<br>1. The source of the Constitution,<br>2. The statement of its objectives,<br>3. The date of its adoption and enactment.<br>✓ Preamble begins with a short statement of its basic values and it contains the philosophy on which our Constitution is built. It is just like an introduction or preface of a book. Preamble actually embodies the spirit of the Constitution.<br>✓ It is a key to the minds of the draftsmen.<br>✓ It is also the soul of the Constitution.<br>PREAMBLE AND ITS INTERPRETATION<br>“We, The People of India…”<br>→ This phrase simply indicates that it’s we people, the people of India who are the source of authority behind the Constitution.<br>→ This also has an implication that the Constitution has been drawn up and enacted by the people through their representatives, and not just handed down to them by a king or any outside powers.<br>“..having solemnly resolved to constitute India..”<br>→ That is to say that by declaring such a phrase we have actually abide ourselves in it’s true spirits to follow and give full effect to the policies and principles laid down in the Constitution.<br>“sovereign”<br>1 AIR 1960 SC 858 2 AIR 1973 SC 1461 3</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'></td><td style='padding:6px'>Preamble is an expressionary statement in a document that</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>explains the document's purpose and underlying philosophy.

I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>→ This indicates that India is a sovereign, a nation free from any external control or interference i.e. no external power can dictate the government of India. India is internally and externally sovereign i.e. externally free from the control of any foreign power and internally, it has a free government which is directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people.<br>→ Constitution may appear to be sovereign as it is the supreme Law of the land. However, a document cannot be a sovereign. The people of India, according to this Constitution have given to themselves this Constitution and therefore, we can say that the political sovereignty lies in<br>“We, the people..” and the legal sovereignty lies in the Constitution of India.<br>→ The word “Sovereign” emphasizes that India is no more dependent upon any outside authority.<br>→ It’s membership of that Commonwealth of Nations and that of the United Nations Organization do not restrict her sovereignty.<br>“socialist”<br>→ The word “socialist” was not there in the original draft of the Constitution. This has been incorporated in the Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment, 1976.<br>→ This is also reflected in the words “..economic justice..” in the preamble. In a democracy,<br>socialism simply refers to a system of government in which the means of productions are wholly or partly controlled by the State.<br>→ It implies social and economic equality. Social equality in this context means the absence of discrimination on the grounds only of caste, colour, creed, sex, religion, or language. Under social equality, everyone has equal status and opportunities. Economic equality in this context means that the government will endeavour to make the distribution of wealth more equal and provide a decent standard of living for all. This is in effect emphasized a commitment towards the formation of a welfare state. India has adopted a socialistic and mixed economy and the government has framed many laws to achieve the aim.<br>→ In D.S. Nakara v. Union of India (UoI), the Supreme Court has observed that the basic framework of socialism is to provide a decent standard of living to the people and specially provide basic social security from cradle to grave. Therefore, it clearly marks the economic equality and equitable distribution of income.<br>{Art. 39(b) and (c)}<br>“secular”<br>→ The word “secular” also was not there in the original draft of the Constitution. This has also been incorporated in the Preamble by the Constitutional (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976.<br>→ It simply indicates that the State does not recognize any religion as its own religion and thus,<br>treats all religions equally. It’s a status of being neither pro-religion nor anti-religion. It is also not based on total neutrality towards religion. It is based on equal respect for all religions. It embodies the age old concept of ‘sarva dharma sambhava’.<br>→ Art. 25 to 28 constitutes the right to freedom of religion<br>→ Citizens have complete freedom to follow any religion, and there is no official religion. The Government treats all religious beliefs and practices with equal respect and honour.<br>→ In a secular State, the State regulates the relationship between man and man and it is actually not concerned with the relation of man with God.<br>“democratic”<br>→ This is based on the legal status of “Damus Cratus” which means rule of people i.e. where the Government gets its authority from the will of the people. The rulers are elected by the people and are responsible to them.<br>→ There is a famous definition of democracy as given by Abrahim Lincoln that “democracy is by the people, of the people and for the people.”<br>4</p><hr><h3>Page 5</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>→ The first part of the preamble “We, the people of India” and, its last part “give to ourselves this Constitution” clearly indicate the democratic spirit involved even in the Constitution. India is a democracy.<br>→ This simply means that the government of our country is carried on by the people of the State through their representatives and the executive head of the State i.e. the President of India is an elected representative of the People (and not a hereditary monarch as like King of England).<br>In India, President is elected by the people although he is elected indirectly. The people of India elect their governments at all levels (Union, State and local) by a system of universal adult franchise; popularly known as "one man one vote". Every citizen of India, who is 18 years of age and above and not otherwise debarred by Law, is entitled to vote. Every citizen enjoys this right without any discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion or education.<br>“republic”<br>→ The Constitution of India is republican in nature as the executive head of India is not any hereditary monarch. This indicates the form of Government in which the Head of State will be an elected person and not a monarch like the King or the Queen in England. Such elected Head will be the Chief Executive Head.<br>→ This concept of being republic is taken from France.<br>→ As opposed to a monarchy, in which the head of state is appointed on hereditary basis for a lifetime or until he abdicates from the throne, a democratic republic is an entity in which the head of state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure, the President of India is elected by an electoral college for a term of five years. The post of the President of India is not hereditary. Every single citizen of India is eligible to become the President of the country. The leaders of the state and local bodies are also elected by the people in similar manner.<br>→ India became a republic on 26th January, 1950.<br>“..and to secure to all its citizens..” - This is a declaratory statement wherein the ultimate objective of the Constitution lies.<br>“..justice, social economic and political..”<br>Here, these words indicate that the Indian Constitution aims at achieving three-fold justice. It’s simply about the attainment of common good and that the people cannot be discriminated on the basis of caste, religion or gender or so and that the government or the State should work for the welfare of the people as a whole irrespective of their social status.<br>→ Economic justice can be and ought to be ensured by rational policy making and it’s proper implementation. Socio-economic justice has been ensured by provision such as Art. 38 and 39.<br>→ Political justice is ensured by way of the right of adult franchise i.e. exercise of right to vote as soon as a citizen attains the age of 18 years.<br>→ Social justice actually requires the abolition of all sorts of inequities which result from inequalities of wealth, opportunity, race, caste and religion. Art. 14 to Art.18 provides for equality of status and opportunity.<br>→ The concept of social justice thus enables the legislature to enact and the Courts to uphold such legislations-<br>(a) to protect the interests of the weaker sections;<br>(b) to remove economic inequalities;<br>(c) to provide a decent standard of living to the people of the country.<br>“..liberty, of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship..”<br>The Constitution regards liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship to be essential to the development of the individual and the nation, and therefore the Preamble itself promises to ensure the same to it’s citizens. In simple words, there are no unreasonable restrictions on the citizens in what they think, how they think, how they wish to express their 5</p><hr><h3>Page 6</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I thoughts and the way they wish to follow up their thoughts in action. {Art. 19(1), Art. 25, Art.26 makes provision of such liberty}<br>“..fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation..”<br>“Fraternity” means the spirit of brotherhood. Simply put it’s that all of us should behave as if we are members of the same family and no one should treat any other person as inferior owing to any factor. India being a multilingual and multi-religious State, the unity and integrity can be preserved only through a spirit of brotherhood that pervades the entire country, among all its citizens, irrespective of their differences. Indian Constitution provides for a single citizenship. All citizens have been given the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. [Art.19(1)(d) and Art.19(1)(e)]<br>“..In our Constituent Assembly this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do hereby ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.”<br>This is a declaratory statement about the adopting, enacting the Constitution.<br>Art. 394 and some other Articles such as Art. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 379, 380, 388, 391,<br>392 and 393 came into force on 26th Nov.,1949 (celebrated as Lawyer’s day)<br>The remaining provisions of this Constitution came into force later on 26th January,1950 which day is referred to as the day of commencement of this Constitution. (As also celebrated as the Republic Day)<br>PREAMBLE WHETHER A PART OF CONSTITUTION OR NOT??<br>&<br>WHETHER AMENDABLE OR NOT??<br> In Re Berubari Case {AIR 1960 SC 845}<br>The Supreme Court held that preamble is not a part of the Constitution as it does not create any substantive rights or obligations or powers. It cannot be a source of powers or restrictions on such powers. Further held that preamble is just an important tool for the interpretation of the Constitution.<br> In Keshwanand Bharti’s case {AIR 1973 SC 1461}<br>It was held that preamble of the Constitution cannot be compared to the preamble of any other statute. It was also held that the objectives stated in the Preamble reflect the basic structure of the Constitution. Thus, it must be considered a part of the Constitution. It was not a provision as held in the Berubari’s case.<br> S.R. Bommai v. UoI {AIR 1994 SC 1918}<br>Supreme Court held that the preamble forms a part of the Constitution.<br>6</p><hr><h3>Page 7</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I CAN PREAMBLE BE AMENDED??<br>✓ As far as the power of the Parliament to amend the Preamble is concerned, it can be concluded that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution and therefore it can be amended by the Parliament under Article 368 but the ‘basic features’ in the Preamble cannot be amended.<br>✓ Till date, preamble has been amended only ones i.e. by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act,<br>1976.<br>✓ By this 42nd Amendment, four words were added in the preamble i.e. “socialist”, ”secular”, “and integrity”<br> The Constitution of India has some outstanding features which distinguish it from other Constitutions. The framers of our Constitution studied other Constitutions, selected their valuable features and put them with necessary modifications in our Constitution.<br> The framers of the Constitution of India did not aim at a completely new or original Constitution. They just wanted to produce "a good and workable" Constitution. And they succeeded doing this. The fact that the Constitution, for last 59 years, has been working satisfactorily is a testimony to its quality and utility.<br>1) Written and lengthiest Constitution<br>✓ There are two types of Constitutions in the world. Most of the Constitutions are written. The first modern written Constitution was the American Constitution. On the other hand, the British Constitution is unwritten. It consists of customs and conventions which have grown over the years.<br>✓ In India, we have a written Constitution. The framers of our Constitution tried to put everything in black and white. Indian Constitution can be called the largest written constitution in the world because of its contents. In its original form, it consisted of 395 Articles and 8 Schedules to which additions have been made through subsequent amendments.<br>At present it contains 395 Articles and 12 Schedules.<br>There are various factors responsible for the long size of the Constitution. The Constitution became lengthy mainly due to the following factors-<br>(a) The Constitutional draftsmen wanted to put everything in black and white and that too in great detail.<br>(b) In other federations, there are two Constitutions: one for the federation and the other for the states. In India, the states do not have separate Constitutions. The powers of states along with the powers of the federation i.e. the Union have been vested in one Constitution.<br>(c) The Government of India Act, 1935 was in operation when India got independence. Our leaders were familiar with this Act. They borrowed heavily from this lengthy Act while framing our Constitution.<br>(d) India is a country of great diversity. It is a country of several minorities; it has many languages, castes, races and religions. The problems and interests of these different groups have found place in one Constitution leading it to be a long document.<br>7</p><hr><h3>Page 8</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>(e) Good features of other Constitutions have been included, with necessary modifications, in our Constitution. For example, we have brought the 'bill of rights' from the American Constitution, parliamentary system of government from the British Constitution and Directive Principles of State Policy from the Irish Constitution.<br>While including these elements of other Constitutions in our Constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar said the framers of our Constitution tried to remove their faults and suit them to our conditions.<br>2) Preamble<br>✓ The Preamble describes the source, nature, ideology, goals and objectives of the Constitution.<br>The Constitution declares India to be a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic. The words, 'Socialist' and 'secular' were added in the Preamble of the Constitution by 42nd amendment which was passed in 1976.<br>✓ It underlines the national objective of social justice economic justice and political justice as well as fraternity. It emphasises the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.<br>Sovereign: Sovereign means absolutely independent; it is not under the control of any other state.<br>Before 1947, India was not sovereign as it was under the Britishers. Now it can frame its policy without any outside interference.<br>Socialist: Word 'Socialist' was added in the Preamble by 42nd Amendment of the Constitution which was passed in 1976. This implies a system which will endeavour to avoid concentration of wealth in a few hands and will assure its equitable distribution amongst all the people of the nation. It also implies that India is against exploitation in all forms and believes in economic justice to all its citizens. Indian Socialism is basically a combination of Marxist and Gandhian ideology.<br>Secular: The word 'Secular', like Socialist, was also added in the Preamble by 42nd Amendment of the Constitution. India is a country of several religions but India has no official religion of the Indian State. There is no State Religion. In matters relating to religion, the state is neutral and non-<br>interfering. It does not patronize any religion. Nor does it discriminate against any religion. Every citizen is free to follow and practise the religion of his/her own choice. The state cannot discriminate among its citizens on the basis of religion or it cannot force a citizen to accept any specific religion.<br>Democratic: Democracy means that the power of the government is vested in the hands of the people. People exercise this power through their elected representatives who, in turn, are responsible to them. All the citizens enjoy equal political rights. Our Constitution lays a lot of emphasis on democratic values, and a number of democratic institutions have been established to give shape to these values. The centre, states and local self-governing bodies follow democratic principles, and all elections from gram panchayats to parliament are democratically held.<br>Republic: Means that the head of the State is not a hereditary monarch but a President who is indirectly elected by the people for a definite period is actually the political head of the nation.<br>3) Federal government<br>✓ The Constitution provides for a federal form of government. In a federation, there are two governments - at the central level and at the state level. In India, the powers of the government are divided between the central government and state governments.<br>✓ Article 1 of the Constitution of India says: - "India, that is Bharat shall be a Union of States."<br>Though the word 'Federation' is not used, the government is federal. A state is federal when<br>(a) there are two sets of governments and there is distribution of powers between the two, (b)<br>there is a written constitution, which is the supreme Law of the land and (c) there is an independent judiciary to interpret the constitution and settle disputes between the centre and the states. All these features are present in India. There are two sets of government, one at the centre, the other at state level and the distribution of powers between them is quite detailed in our Constitution. The Constitution of India is written and the supreme Law of the land. At the 8</p><hr><h3>Page 9</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I apex of single integrated judicial system, stands the Supreme Court which is independent from the control of the executive and the legislature.<br>✓ But in spite of all these essential features of a federation, Indian Constitution has a centralizing or a unitary tendency. While other federations like U.S.A. provide for dual citizenship, the India Constitution provides for single citizenship. There is also a single integrated judiciary for the whole country. The provision of All India Services, like the Indian Administrative Service, the India Police Service, and Indian Forest Service prove another unitary feature. Members of these services are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission on an All-India basis.<br>Because these services are controlled by Union Government, to some extent this constitutes a constraint on the autonomy of states.<br>✓ A significant unitary feature is the Emergency provisions in the Indian constitution. During the time of emergency, the Union Government becomes most powerful and the Union Parliament acquires the power of making laws for the states. The Governor placed as the constitutional head of the state, acts as the agent of the centre and is intended to safeguard the interests of the centre. These provisions reveal the centralising tendency of our federation.<br>✓ Prof: K.C. Wheare has rightly remarked that Indian Constitution provides, "a system of government which is quasi-federal, a unitary state with the subsidiary unitary features". The framers of the constitution expressed clearly that there exists the harmony of federalism and the unitarism. Dr. Ambedkar said, "The political system adopted in the Constitution could be both unitary as well as federal according to the requirement of time and circumstances". We can say that India has a "Cooperative federalism" with central guidance and state compliance.<br>✓ There are three different lists of subjects given under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution<br>- Union list, State list and Concurrent list.<br>✓ The Union list contains 97 subjects of national importance like Defence, Foreign Affairs,<br>Currency, Post and Telegraph, Railways. On these subjects, only central legislature<br>(Parliament) can make laws.<br>✓ The State list contains 66 subjects of local importance. On these subjects, state legislatures make laws. These subjects include agriculture, police, and jails.<br>✓ Concurrent list contains 47 subjects which are of common concern to both the central and state governments. These include education, roads, social security etc. On these subjects, both the parliament and state legislatures can legislate. However, if there is a conflict between a central Law and the state Law over a subject given in the concurrent list, the central Law will prevail.<br>4) Parliamentary government<br>✓ India has adopted the Parliamentary system as found in Britain. In this system, the executive is responsible to the legislature, and remains in power only as long and it enjoys the confidence of the legislature. The president of India, who remains in office for five years is the nominal,<br>titular or constitutional head. The Union Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head is drawn from the legislature. It is collectively responsible to the House of People (Lok Sabha), and has to resign as soon as it loses the confidence of that house. The President, the nominal executive shall exercise his powers according to the advice of the Union Council of Ministers, the real executive. In the states also, the government is Parliamentary in nature.<br>✓ Indian Constitution provides for a parliamentary form of government. The majority party in the Lower House (Lok Sabha) forms government. The Council of Ministers is collectively 9</p><hr><h3>Page 10</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I responsible to the Parliament. The Cabinet is the real executive head. In Presidential form of government, the President is the executive head. In India, the President is only the nominal head.<br>✓ In Britain, the monarchy is hereditary. But in India, the post of President is elective.<br>5) Three Tier Government<br>✓ Indian Constitution provides for a three tier government.<br>✓ Originally, it was two tier i.e. Centre and the State<br>✓ But by 73rd and 74th Amendment Act, 1992 three tier government has been established.<br>(Centre, state & local self government)<br>✓ Panchayat raj system was adopted by way of these two amendments.<br>6) Fundamental rights and duties<br>✓ These rights are fundamental because they are basic to the moral and spiritual development of the individual and these rights cannot be easily abridged by the parliament.<br>✓ Now the citizen enjoys six fundamental rights, originally there were seven fundamental rights.<br>One of them was taken away from Part III of the Constitution by the Forty-fourth Amendment Act, 1978. As a result, the Right to Property is no longer a fundamental right. Since 1978, it has become a legal right.<br>✓ The idea of fundamental rights has been borrowed from the American Constitution.<br>✓ Any citizen of India can seek the help of High Court or Supreme Court of India if any of his fundamental rights is undermined by the government or any institution or any other government.<br>✓ Fundamental rights are justiciable in nature. (i.e. they are legally enforceable by the court of Law). These are not absolute in nature & are subject to some restrictions. Parliament can amend them but not those provisions that form the “basic structure” of the Constitution.<br>✓ Suspended during National Emergency (Except Art 20 & 21).<br>✓ The Constitution of India guarantees six fundamental rights to every citizen. These are:<br>i. Right to Equality.[Article 14-18]<br>ii. Right to Freedom. [Article 19-22]<br>iii. Right against Exploitation. [Article 23,24]<br>iv. Right to Freedom of Religion. [Article 25-28]<br>v. Cultural and Educational Rights. [Article 29, 30]<br>vi. Right to Constitutional Remedies. [Article 32]<br>(Right to property (Article-31) originally a fundamental right has been omitted by the 44th Amendment Act. 1978. It is now a legal right.)<br>7) Fundamental Duties<br>✓ Non-justiciable in nature (i.e. they are not legally enforceable by the court of Law)<br>✓ Not present in the original Constitution. (Added by 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 on the recommendation by Swarn Singh committee.)<br>✓ Reminds people that while enjoying rights they have some duties to do.<br>8) Directive principles of state policy<br>✓ These principles are in the nature of directives to the government to implement them for establishing social and economic democracy in the country.<br>✓ The Directive Principles of State Policy are enumerated in Part IV of the Constitution. The framers of our Constitution took the idea of having such principles from the Irish Constitution.<br>10</p><hr><h3>Page 11</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>✓ These principles have been stated a; "fundamental in the governance of the country".<br>✓ They are instructions or directives from the Constitution to the state and the government. It is the duty of the government to implement them.<br>✓ Non-justiciable in nature (i.e. they are not legally enforceable by the court of Law) but they are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country.<br>✓ Promotes social and economic democracy<br>✓ In general, the Directive Principles aim at building a Welfare State. These principles provide the criteria with which we can judge the performance of the government.<br>Some of the important Directive Principles are:<br>(1) There should not be concentration of wealth and means of production to the detriment of common man;<br>(2) Workers should be paid adequate wage & there should be equal pay for equal work for both men and women;<br>(3) Weaker sections of the people, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people should be given special care;<br>(4) The state should promote respect for international Law and international peace.<br>✓ All the governments-Central, State and Local-are expected to frame their policies in accordance with these principles. The aim of these principles is to establish a welfare state in India. They,<br>however, are not binding on the government-they are mere guidelines.<br>9) Fundamental Duties<br>✓ A new part IV (A) after the Directive Principles of State Policy was incorporated in the constitution by the 42nd Amendment, 1976 for fundaments duties. Fundamental Duties did not form part of the Constitution. Ten Fundamental Duties were inserted in Part IV by the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.<br>✓ A new Article - Article 51-A enumerates ten Fundamental Duties. These duties are assigned only to citizens and not to non-citizens. These duties are not justifiable (i.e. These cannot be enforced through the courts of Law)<br>✓ The purpose of incorporating these duties in the Constitution is just to remind the people that while enjoying their right as citizens, should also perform their duties for rights and duties are correlative.<br>10) Partly rigid and partly flexible<br>✓ Whether a Constitution is rigid or flexible depends on the nature of amendment.<br>✓ The Constitution of India is neither wholly rigid nor wholly flexible. It is partly rigid and partly flexible. It is because of the fact that for the purpose of amendment, our Constitution has been divided into three parts:<br>(a) Certain provisions of the Constitution can be amended by a simple majority in the Parliament.<br>(b) Certain provisions can be amended by a two-third majority of the Parliament and its ratification by at least half of the states.<br>(c) The remaining provisions can be amended by the Parliament by two-third majority.<br>✓ These different amendment procedures make our Constitution partly flexible and rigid. In fact,<br>there is a balance between rigidity and flexibility in our Constitution.<br>✓ Some amount of flexibility was introduced into our Constitution in order to encourage its growth.<br>✓ Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru feared that if a Constitution is too rigid, it will be stagnant and that the growth of the nation would be hampered.<br>11</p><hr><h3>Page 12</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I 11) Single citizenship<br>✓ In a federation, normally we have double citizenship. In the United States of America, there is double citizenship. An American is a citizen of America and at the same time he is also a citizen of one of the 50 States of America where he resides. In India, there is only single citizenship.<br>Every Indian, irrespective of his place of birth or residence, is a citizen of India only. He is not a citizen of any Indian state. There is no citizenship of Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, U.P. or so.<br>✓ Single citizenship is meant to ensure national unity and national integration.<br>12) Universal Adult Franchise<br>✓ Article 326 of the Constitution of India provides Universal Adult Franchise. It means that every citizen of India who has completed 18 years of age is eligible to vote in general elections irrespective of his caste, creed, sex, religion or place of birth. This is one of the most revolutionary aspects of Indian democracy.<br>13) Language Policy<br>✓ The Constitution has also defined the language policy. India is a country where different languages are spoken in various parts of the country. Hindi and English have been made official languages of the Central Government. A state can adopt the language spoken by its people in that state also as its official language.<br>✓ Although India is a multi-lingual nation, the Constitution provides that Hindi in Devnagri script will be the national language. It shall be the duty of the union to promote and spread Hindi language.<br>✓ At present, we have 22 languages which have been recognised by the Indian Constitution.<br>These are: Assamese, Gujarati, Konkani, Marathi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi,<br>Maithili, Nepali, Santhali, Urdu, Bodo, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Sindhi, Dogri,<br>Kashmiri, Manipuri, Punjabi, Tamil.<br>14) Independent judiciary<br>✓ The Indian Constitution provides for an independent judiciary as also envisaged as a directive principle laid down under Art. 50 i.e. “Separation of judiciary from executive”. The judiciary has been made independent of the Executive as well as the Legislature.<br>✓ The judiciary in India is independent and impartial. It is an integrated and a hierarchical judiciary with the Supreme Court at the apex of the hierarchy. The High Courts stand in its middle, and the lower courts are located at its bottom.<br>✓ The Judges security of tenure and it is extremely difficult to remove any Judge of the Supreme or of the High Court through impeachment.<br>✓ Also, the Supreme Court and the High Courts have the power of Judicial Review. They have the power to declare acts of legislatures and actions of the Executive ultra vires and such acts or actions are found to be in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution.<br>15) A Constitution derived from many sources<br>✓ The framers of our Constitution borrowed many things from the Constitutions of various other countries and included them in our Constitution. That is why some writers call Indian Constitution a 'bag of borrowings'.<br>16) Emergency provisions<br>✓ The framers of our Constitution had realised that there could be certain dangerous situations when government could not be run as in ordinary time. Hence our Constitution contains certain emergency provisions.<br>✓ During emergency the fundamental rights of the citizens can be suspended and our government becomes a unitary one.<br>12</p><hr><h3>Page 13</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I 17) Federal Government with Unitary Bias<br>✓ India is a federation, although word 'federation' does not find a place in the whole text of the Indian Constitution. The elements of federation are present in the Indian Constitution. It is a written and rigid Constitution.<br>✓ There is dual polity and there is Constitutional division of powers between the centre and the states. There is also an independent judiciary. The Supreme Court arbitrates the disputes between the centre and the states.<br>✓ All these provisions make India a federation. But in Indian Federation, the centre is strong as compared to the states. The centre has more financial powers and the states largely depend upon it for their economic development. The Governor acts as the agent of the centre.<br>✓ The centre can reorganize a state, but a state cannot reorganize the centre. In other words, the centre is indestructible while the states are destructible. During emergencies, the powers of the centre considerably grow and the states become weak.<br>✓ K. C. Where has described the Indian government as 'quasi-federal'. India has also been characterised as 'a federal state with unitary spirit.‘<br>✓ Indian Constitution establishes India as the federal system of government. Federal system means a political system where is there division of powers between centre and State. But Indian federal system is unique in itself as it has a strong centre.<br>✓ So, Indian Political structure can be rightly described as “federal system with strong centre”<br>NATURE OF VARIOUS CONSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD Nature of Constitution necessarily depends upon the types of Constitution Written or unwritten Constitution: Most of the countries over the world have a written Constitution.<br>Best example of an unwritten Constitution is British Constitution (UK)<br>❑ Rigid or Flexible Constitution<br>→ A Constitution is rigid if for the amendment or review of its provisions, a special provision is required to be followed. Example - Constitution of USA.<br>→ A Constitution is flexible if its provisions can be amended or revised by the ordinary legislative process. Example - Constitution of UK<br>→ A rigid Constitution possesses the quality of stability. And the drawback of being a rigid Constitution is that such a Constitution cannot be tuned in accordance with the needs of the society as and when required. It places obstacles in the required social changes.<br>→ Flexible Constitution, on the other hand, can be easily amended according to the needs of the society but the drawback is that such a Constitution lacks stability.<br>❑ Federal and Unitary Constitution Typically, democratic Constitutions are classified into two categories-<br>❑<br>UNITARY FEDERAL CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTION<br>→ Constitution which provides for a federal system of government is called a Federal Constitution, while a Constitution which provides for a unitary form of government is called a Unitary Constitution.<br>13</p><hr><h3>Page 14</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>→ In a Unitary Constitution, all the powers of the government are given to the Centre and the local govt. enjoy the powers delegated to them by the Centre.<br>→ The federal Constitution establishes a federal system of government. It establishes a system of double government – Central government, and the State government.<br>❑ Merits of Unitary Constitution 1. Unitary Constitution establishes a strong Central Government which is found more useful in times of war and emergencies.<br>2. The Central govt. has all the powers of the govt. and the local or the State govt. just enjoys the powers delegated to them.<br>3. No conflict of authority and no overlapping of jurisdiction.<br>4. Unitary Constitution is more flexible.<br>❑ Demerits of Unitary Constitution 1. Unitary Constitution develops centralized bureaucracy.<br>2. The laws are often made in ignorance of the local conditions and needs.<br>3. They are administered by the persons who do not have sufficient knowledge of the local needs.<br>4. Unitary Constitution is more flexible and therefore it does lack stability.<br>CHARACTERISTICS OF FEDERALISM 1. System of double government: India has two sets of government - the Central or Union government and the State government. The Central government works for the whole country and the State governments look after the States. The areas of activity of both the governments are different.<br>2. Distribution of Powers: The Constitution of India has divided powers between the Central government and the state governments. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution contains three lists of subjects which show how division of power is made between the two sets of government. Both the governments have their separate powers and responsibilities.<br>3. Written and rigid Constitution: The Constitution of India is written. Every provision of the Constitution is clearly written down and has been discussed in detail. It is regarded as one of the longest constitutions of the world which has 395 Articles 22 Parts and 12 Schedules.<br>4. Supremacy of the Constitution: The Constitution is regarded as the supreme Law of the land.<br>No Law can be made which will go against the authority of the Constitution. The Constitution is above all and all citizens and organizations within the territory of India must be loyal to the Constitution.<br>5. Independent judiciary and Supremacy of judiciary: The Supreme Court of India is the highest court of justice in India. It has been given the responsibility of interpreting the provisions of the Constitution. It is regarded as the guardian of the Constitution.<br>6. Bi-cameral legislation: In India, the legislature is bi-cameral. The Indian Parliament, i.e., the legislature has two houses - the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya is the upper house of the Parliament representing the States while the Lok Sabha is the lower house representing the people in general.<br>All the above characteristics are present in the Indian Constitution. However, there are certain provisions that affect its federal character.<br>1. Appointment of the Governor of a State – Art.155 and Art.156 provide that the Governor, who is the Constitutional head of a State, is to be appointed by the President and stays only until the pleasure 14</p><hr><h3>Page 15</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I of the President. Further, that the Governor can send the laws made by the state for assent from the President, who can veto the Law.<br>It should be noted that Governor is only a ceremonial held and he works on the advice of council of ministers. In past 50 yrs, there has been only one case (Re Kerala Education Bill), where amendments to a state Law were asked by the centre and that too after the opinion of the Supreme Court. Thus, it does not tarnish the federal character and states are quite free from outside control.<br>2. Power of the Parliament to make laws on subjects in the State list - Under Art. 249, centre is empowered to make laws on subjects in the State list. On the face of it, it looks a direct assault on the power of the states. However, this power is not unlimited. It is exercised only on the matters of national importance and that too if the Rajya Sabha agrees with 2/3rd majority. It should be noted that Rajya Sabha is nothing but the representative of the States. So an approval by Rajya Sabha means that States themselves are giving the power to the centre to make Law on that subject.<br>3. Power to form new states and to change existing boundaries - Under Art. 3, centre can change the boundaries of existing states and can carve out new states. This should be seen in the perspective of the historical situation at the time of independence. At that time there were no independent states.<br>There were only provinces that were formed by the British based on administrative convenience. At that time States were artificially created and a provision to alter the boundaries and to create new states was kept so that appropriate changes could be made as per requirement. It should be noted that British India did not have states similar to the States in the USA.<br>4. Emergency Provisions - Centre has the power to take complete control of the State in the following 3 situations:<br>(a) An act of foreign aggression or internal armed rebellion (Art. 352)<br>(b) Failure of constitutional machinery in a state (Art. 356)<br>(c) Financial Emergency (Art. 360)<br>In all the above cases, an elected State government can lose control of the State and a central rule can be established. In the first case, it is very clear that such a provision is not only justified but necessary to protect the existence of a state. A state cannot be left alone to defend itself from outside aggression.<br>In the third case also, it is justified because a financial emergency could cause severe stress among the population, plunge the country into chaos and jeopardize the existence of the whole country. Such provisions exist even in USA. The second provision is most controversial. It gives the Centre the power to take over the control of a State. However, such an action can be taken only upon the advice of the governor and such an advice is not beyond the purview of the Supreme Court. Thus, it can be safely said that Indian Constitution is primarily federal in nature even though it has unique features that enable it to assume unitary features upon the time of need.<br>❑ Merits of Federal Constitution 1. Federal Constitution better protects the Regional and Local interest.<br>2. Subjects of local interest are entrusted to the regional govt. and that of the national importance are entrusted to the Central govt. Therefore, the local Legislatures gets an opportunity to make laws according to the local needs.<br>3. A federal Constitution tends to develop decentralization.<br>4. A federal Constitution is therefore more democratic in nature.<br>❑ Demerits of Federal Constitution 1. A Federal Constitution leads to the establishment of a weak government. The Central govt. has no direct control over the matters allotted to the regional governments.<br>15</p><hr><h3>Page 16</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I 2. Such weaknesses are evident on the times of emergencies.<br>3. Possibility of development of regionalism.<br>4. Citizens may show a greater loyalty towards their region rather than the Union. This may be a serious threat to the national unity.<br>5. A Federal Constitution, a conflict of authority and overlapping of jurisdiction may always arise and in such a govt., there is a possibility of confusion regarding the responsibility for work to be done and duplication of work.<br>6. Duplication of work may always lead to more administrative expenses.<br>7. A Federal Constitution is rigid in nature and therefore it cannot be amended according to the needs.<br>8. Such double system of govt. is also a cause of the delayed execution and implementation of plans and projects.<br>INDIAN CONSTITUTION WHETHER FEDERAL OR UNITARY??<br> No doubt, Indian Constitution is a blend of features of both Federal as well as Unitary Constitution. But, after observing all the features of Indian Constitution, it is conclusive that it is federal with a unitary bias.<br> Austin rightly says about Indian Constitution, it is a co-operative federalism.<br>Nature of Indian Constitution A controversy has always been there as to the actual nature of the Indian Constitution that,<br>whether the Indian Constitution is federal or unitary in nature. It is mandatory here to examine the basic features of Indian Constitution and critically analyze the same in order to conclude upon its nature.<br>Dr. Ambedkar has categorically said in Constituent Assembly discussions that<br>“notwithstanding certain provisions that centralize the powers, Indian Constitution is essent ially federal.” Prof. Wheare and some other academicians, however, are hesitant in calling it a federal constitution and prefer to term it as "quasi-federal" or "federal with strong centralizing tendency". Though, it should be noted that even Prof. Wheare accept s the existence of certain provisions in the American Constitution, such as depen dence of Senate on States that are contrary to federal character. However, he says that while the principles of federalism should be rigid, the terminology of "federal Constitution" should be wide. A Constitution should be called federal if it displays federal character predominantly.<br>16</p><hr><h3>Page 17</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Comparative analysis of essential features of federal Constitution and Indian Constitution A federal Constitution possesses the following characteristics -<br>1. System of double governments In a federal Constitution, there exists a double government i.e. the Central government and the State or the regional Governments. This feature is also found under the Indian Constitution.<br>2. Distribution of powers A Federal Constitution essentially provides for distribution of powers between the Central and the State Governments. Both the governments are coordinate and independent in their sphere and not subordinate to one another.<br>Indian Constitution also provides for such distribution of powers.<br>LEGI SLATIVE As far as the legislative powers are concerned, the subjects have been divided into three lists as given under the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, namely –<br>UNION LIST STATE LIST CONCURRENT LIST<br> Subjects of national importance such as defense of India, Naval, Military and Air Forces,<br>Foreign Affairs, Railways, National Highways, Foreign Exchange, Banking etc have been placed under the Union List i.e. List I. The union list in all contains 97 items.<br> The subjects of local interest such as public order, police, local government, public health and sanitation, hospitals, agriculture, etc. have been placed under the State list i.e. List II which contains 66 items.<br> The subjects which are of local interest but require uniform treatment all over the country such as education, factories, newspapers, civil or criminal laws, contract have been placed under the Concurrent list i.e. List III which contains 47 items.<br>Parliament i.e. the Central legislature has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters as mentioned under List I. The State legislature has the exclusive power to make laws upon the matters that are mentioned in the State list.<br>Parliament as well as the State legislatures has a concurrent (co-existing) power to make laws on the matters listed in the concurrent list. If there is a conflict between same laws as passed by the Parliament and a State legislature on a particular subject, then the Law passed by the Parliament shall have an over-riding effect or it will prevail and the State Law to the extent of repugnancy will be void.<br>Distribution of powers is an essential feature of Federal Constitution but Indian Constitution also has following characteristics of a Unitary Constitution.<br>(Unitary features)<br>17</p><hr><h3>Page 18</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br> Although Law making power is vested in both, the Parliament and the State Legislature as to the matters enlisted in List 3, but the very factor that if both the above said legislative bodies enact their own legislations on a particular matter and such laws tends to conflict, then the Law passed by the Parliament would prevail and the State Law shall, to the extent of repugnancy, be void.<br> An exception to this is given under Article 254(2) wherein such repugnant Law made by State legislature was reserved for President’s consideration and it has received President’s assent,<br>then such Law may prevail in that State.<br> Also, the residuary power to legislate upon any matter that has not been listed in any of the three lists has been vested in the Parliament. Whereas in American Constitution, such residuary power is vested in the State legislatures.<br>Parliament can also make laws with matters listed in the State list in the following cases –<br>1) Under Art.248 – A general power of the Parliament to legislate upon matters mentioned in State List.<br>2) If Council of States i.e. Rajya Sabha declares by a resolution supported by not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting that it is in the national interest that Parliament should make Law regarding a subject-matter of the State list, it shall be lawful for the Parliament to pass such Law. {valid for 1 year/ceases after 6 months}<br>3) While proclamation of emergency is there.<br>4) If two or more State Legislatures feels that Parliament should legislate upon a matter of common concern to such states, but the Parliament directly does not have a power to legislate upon such matter, then on such request being made by such States, the Parliament can legislate upon the same.<br>5) In case of State emergency (under Art. 356)<br> The provisions under Art. 2 and 3 also indicates the unitary features of the Indian Constitution.<br>Art. 2 – Admission or establishment of new States.<br>Art. 3 – Formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States.<br>Both the above functions and powers to do the same have been vested in the Parliament by the Indian Constitution.<br>ADMINISTRATIVE As such, Indian Constitution provides for distribution of the administrative powers as well. But, there are certain features of being unitary system with this regard as well.<br>1) Art.256 – The State must so exercise their executive powers as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and the Union govt. can also give directions to a State in this regard. If the State fails to comply, the President may impose State emergency on this very ground.<br>FINANCIAL Under a Federal Constitution, the union and the States are financially independent. But,<br>under Indian system, the States are dependent upon the Centre for the grants-in-aid and the financial assistance. This indicates the unitary feature of Indian Constitution.<br>3. Rigid and Written Constitution It is not necessary that a federal Constitution should always be a written Constitution but it has been observed that in most of the countries having a Federal Constitution are generally written Constitutions. India too has a written Constitution and under Art.368, three 18</p><hr><h3>Page 19</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I modes of amendment have been provided, which renders it neither absolutely rigid nor absolutely flexible.<br>4. Independent judiciary - Independence of judiciary is necessary to maintain the federal structure intact.<br>Various provisions to ensure the independence of judiciary are-<br>→ Appointment of judges by the Head of the executive or through independent Commission.<br>→ Difficult procedure for their removal(impeachment)<br>→ No variation in conditions of their services to their disadvantage after their appointment.<br>→ Prohibition of any discussion as to the conduct of any judge.<br>→ Security of tenure.<br>5. Supremacy of Constitution -<br> In India, Constitution is the supreme of the land.<br> All three organs of the Indian democracy i.e. the executive, legislature and the judiciary, all have to abide by and follow the Constitutional principles.<br> Here, judiciary is regarded as the guardian of Indian Constitution and therefore the power of judicial review holds a very significant place as far as the power of judiciary as the guardian of Constitution is concerned.<br> In USA’s Constitution also, since it establishes a federalism, the Constitution is supreme like India.<br> In England, there is supremacy of the Parliament. In England, the Parliament is sovereign.<br> Supremacy of Constitution is also one of the basic structures in the Indian Constitution which cannot be disturbed in the name of a Constitutional amendment.<br> Power of judicial review as provided under Article 13 is a reflection of the independence of the judiciary. Here, it simply means that if the Parliament passes any Law which actually contravenes the basic principles laid down in the Constitution, then the judiciary is empowered to review the Constitutionality of a particular enactment and the judiciary may struck down the said Law as null and void.<br> Art. 32 and Art. 226 are also a different aspect of the independence of judiciary.<br>Comparative analysis of essential features of Unitary Constitution and Indian Constitution<br>→ Single citizenship<br>→ Unified system of Courts.<br>→ Election Commission<br>→ Comptroller and Auditor General of India<br>→ All India Services.

CITIZENSHIP STATE Article 1 (1) of the Indian Constitution provides that- “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.” Thus, Article 1 describes the name by which our Country shall be called or known. The expression “Union of States” has been taken from the Preamble to the North America (Canada) Act,<br>1867. The expression indicates that India is a federation. The Preamble to the Constitution of India declares that the Republic of India is creation of the people of India and not of the States. But, the States are also a creation of the people of India and they cannot break away from the Republic.<br>Although, the Republic of India is described as a union and it cannot be said to be a federation in the strict sense of the term. The Constitution makers had a purpose in choosing the word “Union” in preference to “Federation”. They were of the view that the word “Union” better expresses the fact that the Union of India is not the outcome of an agreement among the old provinces with the result that it is not open to any State or a group of states to secede or withdraw from the Union or to vary the boundary of the states on their free will.<br>Article 1 : Name and territory of the Union<br>(1) India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.<br>(2) The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.<br>(3) The territory of India shall comprise—<br>(a) the territories of the States;<br>(b) the Union territories specified in the First Schedule; and<br>(c) such other territories as may be acquired.<br>According to Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, India is declared a Union of States, and the States and territories are specified in the First Schedule. The territory of India which is described in clause(3)<br>falls under three categories— the State territories, the Union territories, the territories which may be acquired by Government of India.<br>Before the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1953, the Union consisted of States which were classified into three main Categories—Parts A, B and C of the First Schedule. In addition to these there were territories specified in Past D of The First Schedule. Thus there were four categories in all.<br>Thus at the time of the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh amendment) Act, 1956, the Union of India consisted of 10 Part A States, 8 Part B States, 9 Part C States and 1 Part D State.<br>The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, has abolished the three categories and placed all the States of the Union on the same footing as a result of the reorganization made by the State Reorganization Act, 1956. At present, the territory of India consists of 29 states and 7 Union Territories namely the following—<br>21</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'>UNIT-II (A)<br>CITIZENSHIP, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 1.

A territory can be said to have been acquired when the Indian Union acquires sovereignty over such territory. The usual modes of acquisition of territory by a State are cession following a treaty, occupation, subjugation, acquisition and prescription. Thus, foreign territories acquired by India may be admitted into the union or Constitution into new states under Article 2 or may be merged into an existing State under Article 3(a) or 3(b).<br>Article 2 : Admission or establishment of new States - Parliament may by Law admit into the Union,<br>or establish, new States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.<br>The admission or establishment of a new State will be on such terms and conditions as Parliament may think fit.

Subject – Constitutional Law-I Indian Constitution ensures certain fundamental rights which are available to Indian citizens only. Aliens cannot enjoy these rights. Such fundamental rights as exclusively enjoyable by the Indian citizens are enumerated under Articles 15, 16, 18(2), 19 and 29. Also, citizens alone have the right to hold certain high offices such as those of President of India [Article 58 (1)(a)], Vice-President [Article.<br>66(3)(a)], Governor of the State [Article 157], Judge of the Supreme Court [Article 124(3)], High Court Judge [Article 217(2)], Attorney General of India [Article 76(1)] and Advocate General [Article 165].<br>The Constitution lays down sets of provisions relating to citizenship—one set which tells us who are, or who may be deemed to be, Indian citizens at the commencement of the Constitution, the other set tells us that Parliament may make any provision with respect to acquisition and termination of citizenship and all other matters relating to citizenship. The Constitution thus, as it stands, does not contain the exhaustive Law on the subject and that is why a separate enactment (i.e. The Indian Citizenship Act, 1955) has been passed. Citizenship is to be determined as per the Citizenship Act,<br>1955 and the Constitutional provisions.<br>Citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution Article 5 to 8 describes 4 classes of people who were deemed to be citizens of India at the time of the commencement of the constitution-<br>1. Persons domiciled in India 2. Persons who migrated from Pakistan 3. Persons who migrated to Pakistan 4. Persons living abroad i.e., in foreign countries other than Pakistan Citizenship by domicile (Article 5) - A person is entitled to citizenship by domicile if he fulfils two conditions laid down by Article 5. First, he must, at the commencement of the Constitution, have his domicile in the territory of India. Secondly, such person must fulfil any one of the three conditions laid down in the Article, namely,<br>(a) he was born in India,<br>(b) either of his parents was born in India,<br>(c) he must have been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than 5 years immediately before the commencement of the Constitution.<br>Domicile is of two kinds- domicile of origin and domicile of choice. Every person is born with a domicile of origin. It is domicile received by him at his birth. The domicile of origin of every person is the country in which at the time of his birth his father was domiciled. Thus the domicile of origin is a concept of Law. It clings to a man till he abandons it and acquires a new domicile. Every independent person can acquire a domicile of choice by a combination of-<br>(a) actual residence in a particular place, and<br>(b) intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.<br>Citizenship of persons who migrated to India from Pakistan before the commencement of the Constitution (Art. 6)<br>Persons who have migrated from Pakistan to India have been classified into two categories for the purposes of citizenship—<br>(a) those who migrated to India before July 19, 1948, and<br>(b) those who migrated on or after July 19, 1948.<br>{NOTE – 19/07/1948 is the date when permit system was introduced for going from India to Pakistan and for coming from Pakistan to India.}<br>24</p><hr><h3>Page 25</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.)

By birth.<br>2. By descent.<br>3. By registration.<br>4. By naturalisation, and 5. By incorporation of territory into India.<br>1. By Birth— A person born in India on or after the 26th January, 1950, is a citizen of India by birth,<br>when—<br>(1) His father possesses diplomatic immunity and is not an Indian citizen; or<br>(2) His father is an enemy alien and he is born at a place under enemy occupation.<br>2. By Descent— A person born outside India on or after January 26th, 1950, is a citizen of India by descent if at the time of his birth his father was an Indian citizen. But if the father of such a person was a citizen of India by descent only, the person becomes an Indian citizen only when his birth has been registered at an Indian consulate within one year of his birth or the commencement of Citizenship Act,<br>whichever is later, or unless his father is, at the time of his birth, in service under the Government of India.<br>3.

F UNDAMENTAL RIGHTS – EQUALITY, FREEDOM AND SOCIAL CONTROL, PERSONAL LIBERTY, CHANGING DIMENSIONS OF PERSONAL LIBERTY, CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS.<br>4. RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Rights are claims that are essential for the existence and development of individuals. In that sense there will be a long list of rights. Whereas all these are recognized by the society, some of the most important rights are recognized by the State and enshrined in the Constitution. Such rights are called fundamental rights. These rights are fundamental because of two reasons.<br>1. These are mentioned in the Constitution which guarantees them; and 2. These are justifiable, i.e. enforceable through courts.<br>Being justifiable means that in case of a violation of any of the fundamental rights the individual can approach courts for their protection.<br>The fundamental rights were included under Part III of the Indian Constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity. These Fundamental Rights guarantee to each citizen basic substantive and procedural protections from any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions act as a check both on state action as well as the action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed.<br>ORIGIN OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS This Chapter of the Constitution of India is well described as the Magna Carta of India. If a government enacts a Law that restricts any of these rights, it will be declared invalid by courts.<br>As early as in 1214, the English people exacted an assurance from King John for respect of the then ancient liberties. The Magna Carta is the evidence of their success which is a written document.<br>This is the first written document relating to fundamental rights. Thereafter from time to time, the King had to accede to many rights to his subjects. In 1689, the Bill of rights was written consolidating all important rights and liberties of the English people. In France Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789) declared the natural, inalienable and sacred rights of man. Following the spirit of the Magna Carta of the British and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of France, the Americans incorporated the Bill of Rights in their Constitution. The Americans were the first to give 28</p><hr><h3>Page 29</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Bill of Rights a Constitutional status.

Hence, a significant amount of controversy surrounds its status with respect to Part III of the Constitution.<br>Bringing the Judiciary within the scope of Article 12 would mean that it is deemed capable of acting in contravention of Fundamental Rights. It is well established that in its non-judicial functions,<br>the Judiciary does come within the meaning of State. However, challenging a judicial decision which has achieved finality, under the writ jurisdiction of superior courts on the basis of violation of fundamental rights, remains open to debate.<br>Naresh v.

The Court held that the fundamental right is not infringed by the order of the Court and no writ can be issued to High Court.<br>This question has raised a controversy, because of non-mentioning of judiciary under Art, 12.<br>Judiciary is the prominent organ of the State. Legislature frames the Law and executor organ implements them and enjoys vast power of delegated legislation as well. One of the most important functions of Judiciary is to check invasion of fundamental rights by these two organs and their instrumentality.<br>Judiciary is to turn down the rules, regulation etc. which are in clear violation of fundamental rights. Inclusion of judiciary under Article 12 sets judiciary as the possible violator of fundamental rights as well. Judiciary being the guardian of the Constitution is not supposed to violate the Fundamental Rights.<br>Jurists like H.M.Seervai, V.N.Shukla consider judiciary to be State. Their view is supported by Articles 145 and 146 of the Constitution of India.<br>(a) The Supreme Court is empowered to make rules for regulating the practice and procedure of Courts.<br>(b) The Supreme Court is empowered to make appointments of its staff and servants; decide its service conditions.<br>Such kind of administrative duties of the judiciary bring it within the purview of the definition of State Also, in A.R.

It has gained wider meaning which ensures that Part-III can be applied to a larger extent.

Judicial review is adopted in the Indian Constitution from the Constitution of the United States of America.<br>Judicial review has two important functions-<br>→ Of legitimizing government action, and<br>→ The protection of constitution against any undue encroachment by the government.<br>In the Indian Constitution, Judicial Review is dealt with under Article 13 which provides for the judicial review of all legislations in India, past as well as future. This power has been conferred on the High Courts and the Supreme Court of India (Article 226 and Article 32 respectively) which can declare a Law unconstitutional if it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.<br>BASIS AND ORIGIN OF JUDICIAL REVIEW The doctrine of judicial review was for the first time propounded by the Supreme Court of America.<br>Originally, the United States Constitution did not contain an express provision for judicial review.

This doctrine means that if an offending provision can be separated from that which is unconstitutional then only that part which is offending is to be declared as void and not the entire statute. This conclusion can be very well drawn from the words that Article 13 uses i.e. “…to the extent of such inconsistency be void”<br>DOCTRINE OF SEVERABILITY Doctrine of Severability or Separability is incorporated under Art. 13 Clause (2) which states that the State shall not make any laws which take away Fundamental Rights of a citizen. Therefore, laws made after adoption of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly must be compatible with the Constitution, otherwise the laws and amendments will be deemed to be void-ab-initio. Such a Law will be ultra vires (i.e. out of authority)<br>When a part of the statute is declared unconstitutional, then the unconstitutional part is to be removed and the remaining valid portion will continue as valid. The idea is to retain the Act or legislation in force by discarding or deleting only the void portion and retaining the rest. However,<br>invalid part of the Law will be severed only if it is severable, i.e., if after separating the invalid part, the valid part is capable of giving effect to the legislature’s intent, then only it will survive otherwise the court shall declare the entire Law as invalid.<br>RELEVANT CASES A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras [AIR 1950 SC 27]<br>Only Section 14 of Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was held unconstitutional. Applying the doctrine of severability, whole Act except Section 14 was held valid.<br>State of Bombay v. F.N. Balsara [AIR 1951 SC 318]<br>It was observed that the certain provisions of Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949, which have been declared as void do not affect the entire statute, therefore, there is no necessity for declaring the whole statute as invalid.<br>Romesh Thapper v. State of Madras [AIR 1950 SC 124]<br>Supreme Court held that only if the unconstitutional portions cannot be removed then the whole Act will be utra-vires and thus unconstitutional.<br>R.M.D.C. v. Union of India [AIR 1957 SC 628]<br>Supreme Court held that where after removing the invalid portion what remains constitutes a complete Code there is no necessity to declare the whole Act invalid. In such cases, whether the valid parts of the statute are separable from the invalid, the intention of the legislature is the determining factor.<br>THEORY OF ECLIPSE According to Article 13(1), “All pre-constitutional laws, after the coming into force of Constitution, if in conflict with it in all or some of its provisions then the provisions of Constitution will prevail and the provisions of that pre-constitutional Law will not be in force until an amendment of the Constitution relating to the same matter is made.

[AIR 1955 SC 781]. Government of Central Province monopolized motor transport by an Act. Supreme Court held that the pre-constitutional Law that violates fundamental rights is not void ab initio. It is merely eclipsed. When Art 19 was amended to allow the state to monopolize any business, the said act became constitutional again.<br>Post-Constitutional Laws- Clause (2) of Article 13 prohibits the State to make any Law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. If State makes such a Law then that Law will be ultra vires and void to the extent of the contravention. As contrary to Article 13 clause<br>(1), clause (2) makes the inconsistent laws void ab initio.<br>Deep Chand v. State of U.P. [AIR 1959 SC 648]<br>It was held that doctrine of eclipse does not apply to Post-Constitutional Law because such a Law is void ab initio. A subsequent constitutional amendment cannot revive such a Law.<br>State of Gujarat v.

III Additional District Judge, Kanpur [AIR 1984 SC 1260]<br>Held that Doctrine of Eclipse applies to post-constitutional Law and it is applicable to citizens as well.<br>DOCTRINE OF WAIVER Waive means ‘to give away’ or ‘to surrender’<br>Point of concern here regarding Part III of Indian Constitution is that whether can a citizen waive his fundamental rights??<br>As held in Behram v. State of Bombay [AIR 1955 SC 146], the doctrine of waiver has no application to the provision of Law enshrined in Part III of the Constitution of India.

Fundamental rights are an obligation imposed upon the state by the Constitution. It is the court’s duty to enforce them. No person can relieve the State of this obligation.<br>A question arises as to whether the term ‘Law’ in Article 13 (2)<br>includes just ordinary laws or Constitutional Amendment Acts also.<br>If Constitutional Amendment Act is not covered under Law then the Parliament can amend the Fundamental rights by amending the Constitution itself.<br>For the purposes of Article 13, “Law” is defined as including an Ordinance, Order, bye-Law,<br>rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of Law. The definition of “Law” in this Article is wider than the ordinary connotation of Law which refers to enacted Law or enactment.<br>The Supreme Court in Shankari Prasad v.

State of Punjab [AIR 1967 SC 1643], the Supreme Court held that the word ‘Law’ in Article 13 (2) included every branch of Law, statutory, Constitutional, etc., and hence, if an amendment to the Constitution took away or abridged fundamental right of citizens, the amendment would be declared void.<br>In order to remove the difficulty created by the Supreme Court’s decision in Golak Nath’s case, the Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971 was enacted. By this amendment a new clause (4) was added to Article 13 which makes it clear that Constitutional amendments passed under Article 368 shall not be considered as ‘Law’ within the meaning of Article 13 and, therefore, cannot be challenged as infringing the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.

However, the Supreme Court held that the Parliament’s amendment power is limited and is subject to “Basic Structure” of the Constitution.

Equal protection of Law is a more positive concept employing equality of treatment under equal circumstances.<br>Thus, India has taken best aspects of both systems Unitary and federal; i.e. from England we have taken equality before the Law which means supremacy of the Parliament and from America we have taken the equal protection of the laws which means supremacy of the Courts and the Law.<br>Therefore, in India, the administration is based on a compromise between Judicial and Parliamentary Supremacy. This way Indian constitution aims towards establishing a rule of Law.<br>As Dr.Jennings puts it-<br>“Equality before the Law” means that among equals the Law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike.

For example- A police officer has a power to arrest whereas no private individual has that power generally. But, the rule of Law does require that these powers should be clearly defined by Law and that abuse of authority by public officers must be punished by ordinary courts in the same manner as illegal acts committed by private persons.<br>The rule of Law does not prevent certain classes of persons being subject to special rules.

The classification must not be “arbitrary, artificial or evasive” but must be based on some real and substantial bearing, a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislation.<br>Class legislation is that which makes an improper discrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons arbitrarily selected from a large number of persons, all of whom stand in the same relation to the privilege granted and that no reasonable distinction or substantial difference can be found justifying the inclusion of one and the exclusion of the other from such privilege.<br>From the very nature of society there should be different laws in different places and the legislature controls the policy and enacts laws in the best interest of the safety and security of the state. In fact identical treatment in unequal circumstances would amount to inequality. So, a reasonable classification is not only permitted but it is necessary if society is to progress.<br>Classification to be reasonable must fulfil the following two conditions:-<br> Firstly, the classification must be founded on the intelligible differentia.<br> Secondly, the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought or to be achieved by the act.<br>The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the act are two distinct things. What is necessary is that there must be nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act which makes the classification.

Personal Liberty means much more that mere animal existence.<br>3. Article 19 gives some of the freedoms required to enjoy personal liberty, while Article 21 constitutes the rest.<br>4. Since there was no Law which could justify domiciliary visits, they were held to be an unauthorized intrusion into a person’s life and were held to be in violation of Article 21.<br>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [AIR 1978 SC 597]<br>Prior to Maneka Gandhi’s decision, Article 21 guaranteed the right to life and personal liberty to citizens only against arbitrary action of the executive, and not from legislative action. But after this case Article 21 now protects the right to life and personal liberty of citizen not only from the executive action but from the legislative action also.<br>Facts : Maneka Gandhi’s passport was impounded by the Central government under the Passport Act in the interest of the general public and in the name of security reasons. Maneka filed a writ petition challenging the order on the ground of violation of fundamental right of personal liberty under Article 21. The major ground of challenge was the order impounding the passport was null and void as it had been made without affording her an opportunity of being heard in her defence. Also, that such an impounding order was not in accordance with the procedure established by Law.<br>After Maneka Gandhi’s case, there has been a new interpretation of this right. Earlier the concept as understood was that Article 21 gives a safeguard only against executive action which is unsupported by Law. In this case, the Supreme Court made it clear that a procedure established by the legislature must also be reasonable, just and fair and not an arbitrary one. In order that the procedure was just, fair and reasonable, it should conform to the principles of natural justice.<br>The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase "due process" in favour of<br>"procedure established by Law". As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by Law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any Law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading due process into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that "life" under Article 21 meant more than a mere "animal existence"; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life "meaningful, complete and worth living". Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, clean environment, good health, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned. The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002.<br>Francis Coralie v.

The majority view was that in all such institutions, 50% seats should be filled on merit basis and rest 50% seats may be filled by charging a higher fee.<br>TMA Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka [AIR 2003 SC 355]<br>The scheme as laid down by Unni Krishnan case was rejected and it was held that the private institutions may charge a capitation fee but that always remains in the strict regulation of the State Govt.<br>DEATH SENTENCE Various issues involved are-<br>1. DELAY IN EXECUTION In T.V. Vatheeswaram v. State of Tamil Nadu [AIR 1981 SC 643], the Supreme Court held that delay in execution of death sentence exceeding 2 years would be sufficient ground to invoke protection under Article 21 and the death sentence would be commuted to life imprisonment.<br>In Sher Singh v. State of Punjab [AIR 1983 SC 465], the Supreme Court said that prolonged wait for execution of a sentence of death is an unjust, unfair and unreasonable procedure and the only way to undo that is through Article 21. But the Court held that this cannot be taken as the rule of Law and applied to each case and each case should be decided upon its own faces.<br>2. VALIDITY OF HANGING BY ROPE The Rajasthan High Court, by an order directed the execution of the death sentence of an accused by hanging at the Stadium Ground of Jaipur. It was also directed that the execution should be done after giving widespread publicity through the media. On receipt of the above order, the Supreme Court in Attorney General v. Lachma Devi [AIR 1986 SC 467], held that the said direction for execution of the death sentence was unconstitutional and violative of Article 21. It was further made clear that death by public hanging would be a barbaric practice. Although the crime for which the accused has been found guilty was barbaric it would be a shame on the civilised society to reciprocate the same. The Court said “a barbaric crime should not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty.”<br>RIGHT TO DIE WHETHER COVERED UNDER RIGHT TO LIFE??<br>This question came for consideration for first time before the High Court of Bombay in State of Maharashtra v. Maruti Sripati Dubal [1987 Cr.L.J. 549]<br>In this case the Bombay High Court held that the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 includes right to die, and the Hon’ble High Court struck down section 309, IPC which provides punishment for attempt to commit suicide by a person as unconstitutional.<br>In P. Rathinam v. Union of India [(1994) 3 SCC 394] a Division Bench of the Supreme Court supporting the decision of the High Court of Bombay in Maruti Sripati Dubal Case held that under Article 21, right to life also include right to die and laid down that Section 309 of Indian Penal Court which deals with attempt to commit suicide is a penal offence and is unconstitutional as well.<br>This issue again raised before the court in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab [(1996)2 SCC 648].<br>In this case a five judge Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court overruled the P. Ratinam’s case and held that “Right to Life” under Article 21 of the Constitution does not include “Right to die” or “Right to be killed” and there is no ground to hold that the section 309, IPC is constitutionally invalid. The true meaning of the word ‘life’ in Article 21 means life with human dignity. Any aspect of life which makes life dignified may be included in it but not that which extinguishes it. The ‘Right to Die’ if any, is inherently inconsistent with the “Right to Life” as is “death” with “Life”<br>58</p><hr><h3>Page 59</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I A question may arise, in case of a dying man, who is, seriously ill or has been suffering from virulent and incurable form of disease he may be permitted to terminate it by a premature extinction of his life in those circumstances. This category of cases may fall within the ambit of ‘Right to Die’ with dignity as a part of life with dignity. According to the court these are not cases of extinguishing life but only of accelerating the process of natural death which has already commenced.<br>EUTHANASIA Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v. Union of India(2011)<br>On 7 March 2011, the Supreme Court of India legalised passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of life support to patients in a permanent vegetative state. The decision was made as part of the verdict in a case involving Aruna Shanbaug, who has been in a vegetative state for 37 years at King Edward Memorial Hospital. The Court rejected active euthanasia by means of lethal injection. In the absence of a Law regulating euthanasia in India, the court stated that its decision becomes the Law of the land until the Indian parliament enacts a suitable Law. Active euthanasia, including the administration of lethal compounds for the purpose of ending life, is still illegal in India, and in most countries. While rejecting Pinki Virani's plea for Aruna Shanbaug's euthanasia, the court laid out guidelines for passive euthanasia. According to these guidelines, passive euthanasia involves the withdrawing of treatment or food that would allow the patient to live. As India had no Law about euthanasia, the Supreme Court's guidelines are Law until and unless Parliament passes legislation.<br>The following guidelines were laid down:-<br>A decision has to be taken to discontinue life support either by the parents or the spouse or other close relatives, or in the absence of any of them, such a decision can be taken even by a person or a body of persons acting as a next friend. It can also be taken by the doctors attending the patient. However, the decision should be taken bona fide in the best interest of the patient.<br>The question remained as to who is to decide what is the patient’s best interest where he is in a persistent vegetative state (PVS)? Most decisions have held that the decision of the parents, spouse,<br>or other close relative, should carry weight if it is an informed one, but it is not decisive. It is ultimately for the Court to decide, as parens patriae, as to what is in the best interest of the patient, though the wishes of close relatives and next friend, and opinion of medical practitioners should be given due weight in coming to its decision.<br>Even if a decision is taken by the near relatives or doctors or next friend to withdraw life support, such a decision requires approval from the High Court concerned.<br>When such an application is filed the Chief Justice of the High Court should forthwith constitute a Bench of at least two Judges who should decide to grant approval or not. A committee of three reputed doctors to be nominated by the Bench, who will give report regarding the condition of the patient.<br>Before giving the verdict a notice regarding the report should be given to the close relatives and the State. After hearing the parties, the High Court can give its verdict.<br>59</p><hr><h3>Page 60</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY ARREST AND DETENTION [Article 22]<br>Article 22 of the Constitution provides preventive detention laws. The object of preventive detention is to prevent a person from committing a crime and not to punish him as is done under punitive detention.<br>Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate.<br>The Constitution also authorises the State to make laws providing for preventive detention,<br>subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. Article 22 Clause (4) to (7) provides for the rights of a person detained under preventive detention. Art. 22 provides that when a person is detained under any Law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.<br>Preventive detention has not been unknown in other democratic countries like England and Canada but their recourse has been had to it only in war time. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,[AIR 1950 S.C. 27], the Supreme Court had expressed the view that a detenue could not claim the freedom guaranteed by Article 19(l)(d) if it was infringed by his detention.<br>But this view of the court changed in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, [AIR 1970 S.C. 564], and in Maneka Gandhi’s case. The court expressed the view in these cases that a Law relating to preventive detention must satisfy not only the requirements of Article 22 but also the requirements of Article 21 of the Constitution.<br>The legislative capacity of Parliament or the State legislatures to enact a Law of preventive detention is however, limited to Clauses (4) to (7) of Article 22 which lay down a few safeguards for a person subjected to such detention. The scheme of these clauses is to classify preventive detention in three categories, viz.:<br>(a) A preventive detention up to two months, provision for which may be made either by Parliament or a State legislature, in such a case, no reference may be made to an Advisory Board;<br>However, Constitution (44th Amendment Act, 1978) has substituted a new clause for clause<br>(4) which now reduces the maximum period for which a person may be detained without obtaining the opinion of Advisory Board from 3 months to 2 months. The detention of a person for a longer period than 2 months can only be made after obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board.<br>(b) Preventive detention for over three months subject to safeguard of an Advisory Board consisting of persons qualified to act as High Court judges. No person can remain in preventive detention for more than 3 months unless the Board holds that in its opinion,<br>there are sufficient causes for detention.<br>(c) Preventive detention for over three months without the safeguard of an Advisory Board.<br>Such detention is possible if Parliament prescribes by Law the circumstances under which,<br>and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for over three months without reference to Advisory Board.<br>Parliament may also prescribe the maximum period for which a person can be detained in cases (b)<br>and (c). This provision, it has been held is merely permissive and does not oblige Parliament to prescribe any maximum period. Further, Parliament may by Law prescribe the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under Clause (4).<br>60</p><hr><h3>Page 61</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I The following safeguards have been provided to a detenue:<br>(1) Grounds of detention must be communicated Article 22(5) gives the right to the detenue to be communicated the grounds of detention as soon as possible, the detaining authority making the order of detention must as soon as possible communicate to the person detained the grounds of his arrest and to give the detenue the earliest opportunity of making representation against the order of the detention.<br>The clause (5) of Article 22 imposes an obligation on the detaining authority to furnish to the detenue the grounds for detention, “as soon as possible”. The grounds of detention must be clear and easily understandable by the detenue.<br>(2) Right of representation Article 22 imposes an obligation upon the Government to afford the detenue the opportunity to make representation under clause (5) of Article 22. It makes no distinction between order of detention for only two months and less and for those for a longer duration.<br>The obligation applies to both kinds of orders. It is clear from clauses (4) and (5) of Article 22 that there is dual obligation on the appropriate Government and dual right in favour of detenue,<br>namely, (1) to have his representation irrespective of the length of detention considered by the appropriate Government, and (ii) to have once again in the light of the circumstances of the case considered by Board before it gives its opinion. If in the light of the representation, the Board finds that there is no sufficient cause for detention, the Government has to revoke the order of detention and set at liberty the detenue.<br>(3) Advisory Board Article 22 provides that the detenue under the preventive detention Law shall have the right to have his representation against his detention reviewed by an Advisory Board. If the Advisory Board reports that the detention is not justified, the detenue must be released forthwith.<br>If the Advisory Board reports that the detention is justified, the government may fix the period for detention.<br>The Advisory Board must conclude its proceedings expeditiously and must express its opinion within the time prescribed by Law. Failure to do that makes detention invalid. Along with its opinion, the Board must forward the entire record to the Government who is supposed to take a decision on the perusal of the entire record.<br>The Constitution (44th Amendment Act, 1978) has amended Article 22 and reduced the maximum period for which a person may be detained without obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board from 3 months to 2 months.<br>It has also changed the constitution of the Board which shall now consist of a Chairman and two other members. The Chairman must be a sitting judge of the appropriate High Court and other members shall be either a sitting or retired judge of a High Court.<br>The detenue has no right of legal assistance in the proceedings before the Advisory Board. But if the Government is given a facility, it should equally be provided to the detenue.<br>ADM, Jabalpur v.

Union of India and others [1982] also known as “Asiad Workers Case” gave the following explanation:<br>“We are, therefore, of the view that when a person provides labour of service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words “forced labour” under Article 23 of the Constitution of India.”<br>RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION<br>(ARTICLE 25-28)<br>The concept of secularism is implicit in the preamble of the Indian Constitution which declares to secure to all its citizens “liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship.”The word<br>‘secularism’ has been inserted by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. In S.R. Bommai v. UoI (1994), the SC has held that “secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution.”<br>The chief aspects of Indian Secularism are:-<br>1.

The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice.<br>Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution.<br>Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.<br>RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION 1) Religious liberty subjected to public order, morality and health - In the name of religion, no act can be done against public order, morality and health of public. Thus Section 34 of the Police Act prohibits the slaughter of cattle or indecent exposure of one's person in public place.<br>These acts cannot be justified on plea of practice of religious rites. Likewise, in the name of religion 'untouchability' or traffic in human beings' e.g. system of Dev-dasis cannot be tolerated. These rights are subjected to the reasonable restrictions under clause (2) of Article 19. For instance, a citizen's freedom of speech and expression in matters of religion is subjected to reasonable restrictions under Article 19 (2). Right to propagate one's religion does not give right to anyone to "forcibly" convert any person to one's own religion. Forcible conversion of any person to one's own religion might disturb the public order and hence could be prohibited by Law.<br>2) Regulation of economic, financial, political and secular activities associated with religious practices- Clause (2)(a) - The freedom to practice extends only to those activities which are the essence of religion. It would not cover secular activities which do not form the essence of religion. It is not always easy to say which activities fall under religious practice or which are of secular, commercial or political nature associated with religion practice. Each case must be judge by its own facts and circumstances.<br>3) Social Welfare and Social Reforms- Clause (2)(b) - Under this clause, the State is empowered to make laws for social welfare and social reform. Thus under this clause the State can eradicate social practices and dogmas which stand in the path of the country's onward progress. Such laws do not affect the essence of any religion. Prohibition of evil practices such as Sati or system of Devadasi has been held to be justified under this clause. The right protected under this clause is a right to enter into a temple for the purpose of worship. But it does not follow from this that, that right is, absolute and unlimited in character. No one can claim that a temple must be kept open for worship at all hours of the day and night or that he should be permitted to perform services personally which the Acharya alone could perform.<br>The State cannot regulate the manner in which the worship of the deity is performed by the authorised pujaris of the temple or the hours and days on which the temple is to be kept open for Darshan or Puja for devotees. The right of Sikhs to wear and carry Kripan is recognised as a religious practice in Explanation 1 of Article 25. It does not mean that he can keep any number of Kripans.

But this clause shall not apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but was not established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. Thus Article 28 mentions four types of educational institutions:<br>(a) Institutions wholly maintained by the State.<br>(b) Institutions recognised by the State.<br>(c) Institutions that are receiving aid out of the State fund.<br>(d) Institutions that are administered by the State but are established any trust or endowment.<br>In the institutions of (a) type, no religious instructions can be imparted.<br>In (b) and (c) type of institutions, religious instructions may be imparted only with the consent of the individuals.<br>In the (d) type institution, there is not restriction on religious instructions.<br>N Aditya v.

Articles 29 to 30 of the Indian Constitution effectively aim to eradicate this problem by making a provision in the article known as ‘Right to Cultural and Educational rights of Minority groups’.<br>The Cultural and Educational rights are measures to protect the rights of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination.<br>Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.<br>However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50 percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.<br>Article 30 confers upon all religious and linguistic minorities the right to set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture, and prohibits the State, while granting aid, from discriminating against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a religious or cultural minority.<br>The term "minority", while not defined in the Constitution, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50% of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30. In order to claim the right, it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or linguistic minority. Further, the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned, or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority.

The institutions have the responsibility of accepting students on the basis of merit and talent, and not on the basis of language,<br>class and religion. The institutions also have to make sure that the cultural diversity of the country is well-maintained in the form of multifarious languages and various religious groups.<br>Although there appears to be overlapping of provisions in respect to Article 15 (1) and 29 (2),<br>Article 15 (1) is a more general provision stating that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex,<br>caste and religion.

Enforcement of the fundamental rights 67</p><hr><h3>Page 68</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I largely depends upon the degree of independence of the Judiciary and the availability of relevant instruments with the executive authority.<br>Indian Constitution lays down certain provisions to ensure the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. These are as under:<br>(a) The Fundamental Rights provided in the Indian Constitution are guaranteed against any executive and legislative actions. Any executive or legislative action, which infringes upon the Fundamental Rights of any person or any group of persons, can be declared as void by the Courts under Article 13 of the Constitution.<br>(b) In addition, the Judiciary has the power to issue the prerogative writs. These are the extraordinary remedies provided to the citizens to get their rights enforced against any authority in the State. These writs are - Habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo warranto. Both, High Courts as well as the Supreme Court may issue the writs.<br>The Fundamental Rights provided to the citizens by the Constitution cannot be suspended by the State,<br>except during the period of emergency, as laid down in Article 359 of the Constitution.<br>However, Article 32 is referred to as the "Constitutional Remedy" for enforcement of Fundamental Rights. This provision itself has been included in the Fundamental Rights and hence it cannot be denied to any person. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar described Article 32 as the heart and soul of Indian Constitution, without which the Constitution would be reduced to nullity.<br>By including Article 32 in the Fundamental Rights, the Supreme Court has been made the protector and guarantor of these Rights. An application made under Article 32 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court, cannot be refused on technical grounds. In addition to the prescribed five types of writs, the Supreme Court may pass any other appropriate order. Moreover, only the questions pertaining to the Fundamental Rights can be determined in proceedings against Article 32.<br>Under Article 32, the Supreme Court may issue a writ against any person or government within the territory of India. Where the infringement of a Fundamental Right has been established, the Supreme Court cannot refuse relief on the ground that the aggrieved person may have remedy before some other court or under the ordinary Law. The relief can also not be denied on the ground that the disputed facts have to be investigated or some evidence has to be collected. Even if an aggrieved person has not asked for a particular writ, the Supreme Court, after considering the facts and circumstances, may grant the appropriate writ and may even modify it to suit the exigencies of the case.<br>Normally, only the aggrieved person is allowed to move the Court. But it has been held by the Supreme Court that in social or public interest matters, any one may move the Court. Any piece of legislation or Law, which tends to interfere with the power of Supreme Court under Article 32 shall be declared as void. Hence, there is no way that the legislative or the executive authorities can by-pass the power and responsibility entrusted to the Supreme Court by the Constitution.<br>WRITS WRIT OF WRIT OF WRIT OF WRIT OF WRIT OF HABEAS QUO MANDAMUS PROHIBITION CERTIORARI CORPUS WARRANTO 1) Writ of Habeas corpus: It is the most valuable writ for personal liberty. Habeas Corpus means, "Let us have the body." A person, when arrested, can move the Court for the issue of 68</p><hr><h3>Page 69</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Habeas Corpus. It is an order by a Court to the detaining authority to produce the arrested person before it so that it may examine whether the person has been detained lawfully or otherwise. If the Court is convinced that the person is illegally detained, it can issue orders for his release.<br>2) The Writ of Mandamus: Mandamus is a Latin word, which means "We Command".<br>Mandamus is an order from a superior court to a lower court or tribunal or public authority to perform an act, which falls within its duty. It is issued to secure the performance of public duties and to enforce private rights withheld by the public authorities.<br>Simply, it is a writ issued to a public official to do a thing which is a part of his official duty, but,<br>which, he has failed to do, so far. This writ cannot be claimed as a matter of right. It is the discretionary power of a court to issue such writs.<br>3) The Writ of Quo-Warranto: The word Quo-Warranto literally means "by what warrants?” or<br>"by what authority”. It is a writ issued with a view to restraining a person from acting in a public office to which he is not entitled. The writ of quo warranto is used to prevent illegal assumption of any public office or usurpation of any public office by anybody. For example, a person of 62 years has been appointed to fill a public office whereas the retirement age is 60 years. Now, the appropriate High Court has a right to issue a writ of quo-warranto against the person and declare the office vacant.<br>4) The Writ of Prohibition: Writ of prohibition means to forbid or to stop and it is popularly known as 'Stay Order'. This writ is issued when a lower court or a body tries to transgress the limits or powers vested in it. It is a writ issued by a superior court to lower court or a tribunal forbidding it to perform an act outside its jurisdiction. After the issue of this writ, proceedings in the lower court etc. come to a stop.<br>5) The Writ of Certiorari: Literally, Certiorari means to be certified. The writ of certiorari is issued by the Supreme Court to some inferior court or tribunal to transfer the matter to it or to some other superior authority for proper consideration.<br>WRITS OF PROHIBITION, MANDAMUS AND CERTIORARI The writ of prohibition is issued by any High Court or the Supreme Court to any inferior court,<br>prohibiting the latter to continue proceedings in a particular case, where it has no legal jurisdiction of trial. While the writ of mandamus commands doing of particular thing, the writ of prohibition is essentially addressed to a subordinate court commanding inactivity. Writ of prohibition is, thus, not available against a public officer not vested with judicial or quasi-judicial powers. The Supreme Court can issue this writ only where a fundamental right is affected.<br>The writ of certiorari can be issued by the Supreme Court or any High Court for quashing the order already passed by an inferior court. In other words, while the prohibition is available at the earlier stage, certiorari is available on similar grounds at a later stage. It can also be said that the writ of prohibition is available during the pendency of proceedings before a sub-ordinate court, certiorari can be resorted to only after the order or decision has been announced.<br>There are several conditions necessary for the issue of writ of certiorari, which are as under:<br>(a) There should be court, tribunal or an officer having legal authority to determine the question of deciding fundamental rights with a duty to act judicially.<br>(b) Such a court, tribunal or officer must have passed order acting without jurisdiction or in excess of the judicial authority vested by Law in such court, tribunal or Law.<br>The order could also be against the principle of natural justice or it could contain an error of judgment in appreciating the facts of the case.<br>69</p><hr><h3>Page 70</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.)

FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY Introduction-<br>Part IV of the Constitution of Indian contains Directive Principles of State Policy which extends from Articles 36 to 51 (both inclusive). The concept of Directive Principles under Part IV of Indian Constitution have been inspired by the Directive Principles given in the Constitution of Ireland and also by the principles of Gandhism; and relate to social justice, economic welfare, foreign policy, and legal and administrative matters.<br>In previous days, it was thought that the main duty of state is the maintenance of Law and order and the protection of life, liberty and property of the subjects. This was rather a restrictive approach towards the concept of State. The Directive Principles are certain active obligations or guidelines to State which lay down certain economic and social goal to be pursued by the State to attain a welfare State. These principles impose certain obligations on the state to take positive action in certain directions in order to promote the welfare of the people and achieve economic democracy. If we go through the 16 articles contained in Part IV, we will find that these directives extend to almost every field of life, i.e., economic, social, legal, environmental.<br>EXTENT TO WHICH THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATURE AND JUDICIARY IS OBLI GED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY According to Article 37, the directive principles shall not be enforceable by any court, but these principles are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply them in making laws.<br>Here, the word 'State' includes the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. Hence a duty has been imposed upon the organs of the Government to apply these principles in making laws.

Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments i.e. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.<br>Article 47 commits the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health, and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health. As a consequence, partial or total prohibition has been introduced in several states, but financial constraints have prevented its full-fledged application.<br>Article 48 makes it mandatory upon the State to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines by improving breeds and prohibiting slaughter of cattle.<br>Article 48A mandates the State to protect the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.<br>Article 49 places an obligation upon the State to ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance.<br>Article 50 requires the State to ensure the separation of judiciary from executive in public services, in order to ensure judicial independence, and federal legislation has been enacted to achieve this objective.<br>The State, according to Article 51, must also strive for the promotion of international peace and security, and Parliament has been empowered under Article 253 to make laws giving effect to international treaties.<br>72</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Articles 41–43</td><td

Subject – Constitutional Law-I CLASSIFICATION OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY There is a classification of the Directive principles of State policy according to which the Constitutional draftsmen have classified the articles or the provisions falling under Part IV on the basis of their basic purposes or the legislative intent. There are three kinds of Directive Principles of State Policy as enumerated in the Constitution of India from Article 38 to Article 51. They are as follows:-<br>1) DIREC TIVES IN THE NATURE OF THE IDEALS 2) DIRECTIVES OF T HE STATE SHAPING THE POLICY OF THE 3) DIRECTIVES IN THE STATE NATURE OF NON-<br>JUSTICIABLE RIGHTS OF EVERY CITIZEN 1) The directives in the nature of ideals of the State are-<br>(a) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order permeated by social, economic and political justice (Art. 38).<br>(b) The State shall endeavour to secure just and humane conditions of work a living wage a decent standard of living and social and cultural opportunities for all workers (Art 43).<br>(c) The State shall endeavour to raise the level of nutrition and standard of living and to improve the health of the people (Art. 47).<br>(d) The State shall endeavour to promote international peace and amity (Art. 51)<br>(e) The State shall direct its policy towards securing equitable distribution of the material resources of the community and prevention of concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment (Art . 39)<br>2) Directives in the nature of policy of the State–<br>(a) To establish economic democracy and justice by securing certain economic rights.<br>(b) To secure a uniform civil code for the citizen.

I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I FUNDAMENTA L DUTIES Rights and Du ties are like two sides of a coin, absolutely inseparable. Whenever and wherever we have any rights, we must have corresponding duties. Whether it be the home, the society or the country, in every sphere of life we have rights and duties that go hand in hand. We have rights in the same measure as we have duties. The Fundamental Duties are a novel feature of the Indian Constitution. No democratic polity can ever succeed where the citizens are not willing to be active participants in the process of governance by assuming responsibilities and discharging citizenship duties and coming forward to give their best to the country.<br>ORIGIN: The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976 by way of inserting PART IV-A upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. All the fundamental duties were incorporated in one article only i.e. Article 51-A. Originally, constitution had only 10 fundamental duties. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The idea for Fundamental Duties has been borrowed from erstwhile USSR.<br>Fundamental duties are obligatory in nature. But there is no provision in the constitution for direct enforcement of these duties. There is no sanction either to prevent their violation. However the importance of fundamental duties can be gauged from the following facts:<br>(a) As rights and duties are the two side of the same coin, it is expected that one should observe one’s duties in order to seek the enforcement of one’s fundamental rights, in the context if a person approaches the court for the enforcement of any of his fundamental rights, the court may refuse to take a lenient view of him if it comes to know that the concerned individual has no respect for what is expected of him by the state as a citizen of the country.<br>(b) They can be used for interpreting ambiguous statutes. The court may look at the fundamental duties while interpreting equivocal statutes which admit of two constructions.<br>(c) While determining the constitutionality of any Law, if court finds that it seeks to give effect to any of the duties, it may consider such Law to be ‘reasonable’, and thereby, save such Law from unconstitutionality.<br>FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES IN INDIA Under Article 51-A of Indian Constitution, every citizen has been obligated to perform certain duties called the Fundamental Duties.

Ours is a vast country with many languages, sub-cultures and religious and ethnic diversities, but the essential unit of the country is epitomized in the one Constitution, one flag, one people and single citizenship. We are all governed and guided by this Constitution irrespective of caste, religion, race, sex, etc. National Flag and the National Anthem are symbols of our history, sovereignty, unity and pride. We, the citizens of India,<br>have to be equally proud of our nation, our Constitution, our National Flag and our National Anthem. We must put the nation above our narrow personal interests and then only we will be able to protect our hard-earned freedom and sovereignty.<br>(b) To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;<br>The citizens of India must cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired the national struggle for freedom. The battle of freedom was a long one where thousands of people sacrificed their lives for our freedom. It becomes our duty to remember the sacrifices made by our forefathers for the cause of the country. But, what is much more important is to remember, imbibe and follow the ideals which pervaded our unique struggle. It was not a struggle merely for political freedom of India. It was for the social and economic emancipation of the people all over the nation. If we, the citizens of India remain conscious of and committed to these ideals, then only we will be able to do justice with the great struggle of our freedom fighters.<br>(c) To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;<br>It imposes a Fundamental Duty on every citizen of India that he shall not do anything derogatory of upholding or protecting the sovereignty, unity or integrity of India. It is a duty prohibitory in nature addressed to traitors and spies.<br>(d) To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;<br>In modern nation States, it is goes without saying that every citizen is bound to be ready to defend the country against war or external aggression. The present day wars are not fought on the battlefield only nor are they won only by the armed forces; the citizens at large play a most vital role in a variety of ways. Sometimes, civilians may be required also to take up arms in defence of the country.<br>(e) To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities and to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;<br>The duty to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India essentially flows from the basic value of fraternity enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution. India is a country of different castes, languages, religions and many cultural streams but we are one people with one Constitution, one flag and single citizenship.<br>Spirit of brotherhood should come very normally among the citizens of a country like India where the norm has been to consider the entire world as one family. The Constitution also casts upon us the Fundamental Duty of ensuring that all practices derogatory to the dignity of women are renounced. This again should come normally to a country where it is an saying that Gods reside where women are worshipped.<br>(f) To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;<br>Our cultural heritage is one of the noblest and the richest. What we have inherited from the past, we must preserve and pass on to the future generations. In fact, each 78</p><hr><h3>Page 79</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM.

We must hold precious and dear what our fore-fathers have created and their successive generations bequeathed to us as symbols of their artistic excellence and achievements. Generations to come will always draw an inspiration from past history which stimulates them to aim at ever greater heights of achievement and excellence. It becomes the ardent duty of every citizen to ensure that these monuments and pieces of art are not in any way damaged, disfigured, scratched or subjected to vandalism or greed of unscrupulous traders and smugglers.<br>(g) To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures;<br>In the face of the menace of the increasing pollution and environmental degradation, it is the duty of every citizen to protect and improve natural environment including forests,<br>lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures. The rising air, water and noise pollution and large-scale denudation of forest are causing immense harm to all human life on earth. The mindless and wanton deforestation in the name of needs of development is causing havoc in the form of natural calamities and imbalances. By protecting our forests, planting new trees, cleaning rivers, conserving water resources, reforesting wastelands, hills and mountains and controlling pollution in cities, villages and industrial units, we can help save the future of our coming generations and of planet itself. What is needed is a concerted effort at, an awareness campaign and a planned strategy to move forward through voluntary citizen initiatives. Governmental steps alone would not suffice.<br>(h) To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;<br>It is the bounden duty of every citizen to preserve and promote a scientific temper and a spirit of inquiry to keep pace with the fast changing world.<br>(i) To safeguard public property and to abjure violence;<br>It is most unfortunate that in a country which preaches non-violence to the rest of the world, we see from time to time instances of senseless violence and destruction of public property indulged in by a few of its citizens. This is why it became necessary to prescribe the responsibility "to safeguard public property and abjure violence" as a fundamental duty of the citizens.<br>(j) To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;<br>The drive for excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity is the demand of times and a basic requirement in a highly competitive world.

UNION JUDICIARY – SUPREME COURT 4. RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES UNION EXECUTIVE: PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT The Union Executive broadly covers the President, Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister. Under the Indian Constitution, the President of India enjoys a unique position. President is the head of the Union Executive. Article 52 creates the position of the President. The President of India is the head of state of the Republic of India. He is considered to be above party politics and is not a member of any political party.<br>The President is the first citizen of the country and formal head of the executive, legislature and judiciary of India. He is also the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces. He represents sovereignty of the country. He is elected by the elected representatives of the people.<br>POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT UNDER INDIAN CONSTITUTION Article 52 provides that there shall be a President of India and Article 53 provides that the executive powers of the Union shall be vested in the President of India and shall be exercised either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. Thus President of India is bound to act in accordance with the Constitution.<br>Also, Article 74 of the Constitution provides that there shall be Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advice the President of India. Thus, a question arises what does aid and advise mean? Can President of India refuse or disallow or disregard the advice tendered or given by the Council of Ministers to the President? As Article 75 (3) provides, the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People. In Parliamentary form of Government,<br>Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha. Similarly, if President does not act in accordance with the Constitution then there is provision for his impeachment. Under Article 368, a provision has been made that if any Amendment Act has been passed in order to amend the Constitution, the President shall have to sign it. It is very clear from all the above provisions that President cannot go against the wishes of the Council of Ministers as headed by the Prime Minister. He is said to be a puppet in the hands of Prime Minister.<br>DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENT The primary duty of the President is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the Law of India as made part of his oath (Article 60).

It is an act of grace and cannot be claimed or demanded as a matter of right. It is purely an executive act. The decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the President are independent of the opinion of the Prime Minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most cases, however, the President exercises his executive powers on the advice of the Prime Minister and the cabinet.<br>The Presidents power does not affect the similar powers of the Governor and military officers with respect to Court-Martial. It is noteworthy that the Presidents’ judicial power does not include the power to grant amnesty. This power is left to the Parliament.<br>(b) Advisory Jurisdiction under Article 143 also comes under judicial powers of the President.<br>(c) The President enjoys certain privileges in respect to criminal or civil proceedings against him. No criminal proceedings can be started against him during his term of office. Civil proceedings can be initiated only after he has been served with a two months written notice.<br>5. MILITARY POWERS The Supreme Command of the Defence Forces is vested in the President of India, but the Constitution expressly lay down that the exercise of this power shall be regulated by Law.<br>This means that though the President may have the power to take action as to declaration of war or peace or the employment of the Defence Forces, it is competent for Parliament to regulate or control the exercise of such powers.<br>6 . DIPLOMATIC POWERS Like the head of other States, the President of India represents India in international affairs and has the power to appoint Indian representatives to other countries and receives diplomatic representatives of other states.<br>7. EMERGENCY POWERS In addition to the power enumerated above the President of India enjoys vast emergency powers.<br>Article 352 to 360 deals with the emergency provisions. The Constitution visualizes three kinds of emergencies:-<br>(a) Emergency arising out of a threat to the security of India or any part of it by war,<br>external aggression or internal disturbances,<br>(b) Emergency arising out of the failure of the constitutional machinery in any one of the states.<br>(c) Emergency caused by a threat to the financial stability of India.<br>It is the President who determines whether the emergency exists or not. His judgement in this case cannot be questioned. If the President issues a declaration of national emergency caused by war or threat of war he may:-<br>→ Suspend the autonomy of states and empower the Parliament to make laws on all matters including matters in the state list.<br>→ Extend the executive power of the union so as to give directions to any state regarding the manner in which the executive power of the union is to be exercised;<br>→ Suspend the fundamental rights including the right to constitutional remedies.<br>88</p><hr><h3>Page 89</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.)

Looking to these powers one may say that President is no less than a dictator and especially so when an emergency has been declared.<br>However, whatever may be the Constitutional provisions regarding the powers of the President and however vast these powers may be, yet it may be said that the President of India being the head of a parliamentary Government cannot but exercise his powers on the advice of the Council of Ministers which includes the elected representatives of the people.<br>Article 74 clearly provides that "there shall be a Council of Ministers to aid and advice the President in the exercise of these functions. Article 74 is a mandatory provision.<br>The Constitution does not visualize the rule of the President at the centre. The powers of the President are the powers of the Council of Ministers which is responsible to the Parliament. The President must act according to their advice because disregard of their advice would kill the essence of the parliamentary Government which requires that the head of the state should exercise his powers on the advice of the cabinet responsible to the parliament.<br>VICE-PRESIDENT OF INDIA The Vice-President is elected under Article 63 of the Constitution.

I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I WRIT JURISDICTION (ART. 32)<br>The Supreme Court is the guardian of the individual liberties and fundamental rights. It has the power to declare a Law passed by any legislature null and void if it encroaches upon the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people by the Constitution. For the enforcement of fundamental rights, it can issue writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Certiorari, Prohibition and Qua-Warranto.<br>Besides the above mentioned powers, the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review under Art.13. It implies the power to review and determine validity of a Law or an order. It refers to "the power of a court to inquire whether a Law, executive order or other official action conflicts with the written Constitution, and if the court concludes that it does, to declare it unconstitutional and void".<br>However, the Indian Constitution does not in so many words assign the power of judicial review to the court. There are several specific provisions in the Constitution, which guarantee judicial review of legislation such as Articles 13, 32, 131-136, 143, 226, 145, 246, 251, 254 and 372.<br>Apart from these Articles, the power of judicial review is derived from the position of Supreme Court as the guardian of the Constitution.<br>The court can challenge the constitutional validity of a Law on the following grounds:<br>(a) the subject matter of the legislation is not within competence of the legislature which has passed it;<br>(b) It is repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution; or<br>(c) It infringes one of the fundamental rights.<br>The power of judicial review, in general, flows from the powers of the courts to interpret the Constitution. As such it has the final say in the interpretation of the Constitution and by such interpretation; the Supreme Court has extended its power of judicial review to almost all the provi-<br>sions of the Constitution.<br>The limitations on the power of judicial review of the Supreme Court:<br>Under Article 137, the Supreme Court has expressly been given the power to review its judgment. However, this is subject to any Law passed by the Parliament. This power is exercisable under rules made by the Court under Article 145, on grounds mentioned in Order 47, Rule 1 of C. P. C.,<br>a review will lie in the Supreme Court on-<br>(1) Discovery of new and important matter or evidence;<br>(2) Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; and<br>(3) Any other sufficient reason.<br>Article 141 of the Constitution provides that the judgment of the Supreme Court will be binding on all Courts in India.<br>MAINTENANCE OF INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY Only an impartial and independent judiciary can protect the rights of the individual and provide equal justice without force and fear. It is very necessary that the Supreme -Court should be allowed to function without fear and political pressure. There must be security of tenure of the judges,<br>no alteration in the salaries during the term of their office etc. to enable a judge to administer justice freely.<br>103</p><table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;text-align:left;'><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Article 141 of the Constitution provides that the judgment of the Supreme Court will be binding on all</td></tr><tr><td style='padding:6px'>Courts in India</td></tr></table><br><hr><h3>Page 104</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I The Constitution has made the following provisions to ensure the independence of judiciary—<br>(a) Security of Tenure—The Judges of the Supreme Court have security of tenure. They cannot be removed from their office except by an order of the President and that also on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity supported by a resolution adopted by a majority of total membership of each House and also by a majority of not less than 2/3 of the members of the House present and voting. Parliament may, however, regulate the procedure for presentation of the address and for investigation and proof of misbehaviour or incapacity of a Judge. But Parliament cannot misuse this power because the special procedure for their removal must be followed.<br>(b) Salaries etc. are fixed—The salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court are fixed by the Constitution and charged on the Consolidated Fund of India. They are not subject to vote of legislature. During the term of their office, their salaries and allowances cannot be altered to their disadvantage except in grave financial emergency.<br>(c) Jurisdiction of Supreme Court not to be curtailed—In respect of its jurisdiction, Parliament may change pecuniary limit for appeals to the Supreme Court, confer supplementary power to enable it to work more effectively, confer power to issue directions, orders or writs including all the prerogative writs for any purpose other than those mentioned in Art. 132. In this respect, the Parliament can extend but cannot curtail die jurisdiction of Supreme Court.<br>(d) No discussion in Legislature—Neither in Parliament nor in a State Legislature a discussion can take place with respect to the conduct of a Judge of the Supreme Court in discharge of his duties.<br>(e) Appointment of Judges—The Constitution does not leave the appointment of the Judges of the Supreme Court to the unguided discretion of the Executive. The Executive is required to consult Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts in the appointment of the Judges of the Supreme Court.<br>Thus the position of the Supreme Court is very strong and its independence is adequately guaranteed.<br>104</p><hr><h3>Page 105</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.)

The head of the states is called the Governor, who is the constitutional head of the state as the President is for the whole of India.<br>The Governor is usually a distinguished elder states man, who can discharge his rather perfunctory duties with dignity and who is on a position to exercise what Gandhi called an "all pervading moral influence”.<br>The Governor of a state has a dual role to play-<br>(a) as the constitutional head of the state and<br>(b) as the agent or representative of the centre.<br>As per Art. 157, no person shall be eligible for appointment as Governor unless-<br>✓ he is a citizen of India and<br>✓ has completed the age of 35 years<br>→ The Governor of a State shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal [Art.155].<br>→ Subject to the pleasure of the President, he shall hold office for a term of 5 years and on the expiry of such period continues to hold it until his successor enters upon his office.<br>→ The appointment may terminate either upon dismissal by the President or on resignation addressed to President by the Governor. [Art.156].<br>→ The Governor shall not be a member of either House of Parliament or of the Legislature of any State and if any such member is appointed as Governor, his seat as such member shall be deemed to have been vacated on the date on which he enters upon his office as Governor.<br>→ He shall not hold any other office of profit.<br>→ He shall be entitled without payment of any rent to the use of his official residence and shall also be entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by Law, and, until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule of the Constitution.<br>→ The emoluments and allowances of the Governor shall not be diminished during his term of office.

Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>→ He may recommend to the President for President's rule in the State and, according to Art.<br>356, "If the president, on receipt of a report from the Governor or otherwise is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, he may issue a proclamation. By that proclamation the President may assume to himself all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor or anybody or authority in the State”.<br>→ The Governor is to report to the President that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Such a report may sometimes be against a Ministry in power, for example, if it attempts to misuse its power to subvert the Constitution. It is clear that in such casa, the report cannot be made according to ministerial advice. Moreover no such advice will be available where a ministry has resigned and another alternative ministry cannot be formed. Thus, in making report to the President under Art. 356, the Governor exercises his discretion.<br>→ The Ministers of the State hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. The fact that each holds his office at the Governor's pleasure indicates that his office is at all times at the Chief Minister's disposal, for in these matters the Governor, like the King in England, acts on the advice of the Chief-Minister. Moreover for the effective realisation of the rule of Collective Responsibility of the Council of Ministers it is necessary that no person should be nominated to the cabinet except on the advice of the Chief Minister. Secondly no person should be retained as a member of the cabinet if the Chief-Minister says that he should be dismissed.<br>→ The Governor in terms of Article 156 of the Constitution holds office during the pleasure of the President.<br>Dissolution of the Legislative Assembly(Art. 174)<br>The Governor summons, prorogues and dissolves the Legislative Assembly. In normal circumstances the Legislative Assembly is not dissolved by the Governor, till the expiry of its normal tenure of five years. But where ministry has lost the majority and no alternate stable ministry is possible, he may dissolve the House.<br>The Governor is not bound to accept the advice of the defeated Ministry to dissolve the house.<br>In this case he can act according to his discretion. He may or may not dissolve the House. Thus it is clear that the Governor can dissolve the Legislative Assembly in his discretion. Therefore the Governor has constitutional power in dismissing a Council of Ministers on his subjective satisfaction that the Government has lost its majority in the Legislative Assembly and he can very well invite any person to form the Government.<br>According to Article 164, the ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor.<br>This does not mean that the Governor can dismiss his ministers at any time at his sweet will. The expression 'during the pleasure' under a Parliamentary form of Government means the confidence of the majority in the Legislature. He is to exercise his pleasure in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers. This follows from the provision in Article 164(2) which makes the Council of Ministers collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. This means that till a ministry enjoys the confidence of the majority in the Lower House, the Governor should not dismiss it.<br>THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNOR IN RELATION TO HIS COUNCIL OF MINISTERS In general, the relation between the Governor and his ministers is the same as that between the President and his ministers, with this important difference that ,while the Constitution does not 106</p><hr><h3>Page 107</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I empower the President to exercise any functions 'in his discretion' it authorises the Governor to exercise some functions 'in his discretion'. [Article 163(1)].<br>In the exercise of his discretionary pourers the Governor is not required to act on the advice of Chief Minister or even to seek his advice. The Constitution does not define as to what are the discretionary powers of the Governor. This raises an important question whether the Governor like the President is merely a constitutional head or whether he has some real powers. This suspicion is however unfounded in view of the Parliamentary system of Government adopted in the Constitution.<br>When a Cabinet, collectively responsible to the Legislature, is to give advice to the Governor in the discharge of his functions, occasions are almost non-existent from him to act contrary to the advice of the Cabinet.<br>In the time of crisis, the Governor can effectively and constitutionally utilize the provision and act in his discretion particularly in cases where there might be a conflict between the Governor and his Council on any issue. In view of the responsibility of the Governor to the President, one of the act that<br>"the Governor's decision as to whether he should act in his discretion in any particular matter is final",<br>it would be possible for the Governor to act without the advice of his Cabinet even though they are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution as discretionary functions.<br>Thus the Governor may exercise, in exceptional circumstances his own discretionary powers in—<br>(i) The appointment of the Chief Minister ;<br>(ii) the dismissal of Ministry ;<br>(iii) the dissolution, prorogation and suspension of the Legislative Assembly; and<br>(iv) advising the President for the proclamation of emergency.<br>POSITION OF THE GOVERNOR IN RELATION TO THE PRESIDENT The powers of the Governor are analogous to those of the President with certain significant differences. The President is elected to his office, while the Governors are appointed by the President and hold office during his pleasure and may be dismissed from office by him whereas the President may be removed from office only through impeachment.<br>The President addresses his resignation to the Vice-President. The term of office is the same for the President as for a Governor. The oath of office is more or less alike, but not identical.<br>The Powers of the Governor can be discussed under the following four heads-<br>EXECUTIVE POWERS<br>→ The executive power of the State is vested in the Governor to be exercised by him either directly or through the officer’s sub-ordinate to him [Art. 154].<br>→ All executive actions of a State shall be expressed to be taken in his name [Art.164]<br>→ The executive power of a State shall extend to matters in respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws.<br>→ In any matter with respect to which both the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws & if it is a matter mentioned in the Concurrent List, the executive power of the State shall be subject to and limited by the executive power conferred by the Constitution or by any Law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof. [Art. 162]<br>→ The Government appoints the Chief Minister and other Ministers on his advice, and the Council of Ministers hold office during his pleasure but the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the State Legislature or to the Lower House of such Legislature where the 107</p><hr><h3>Page 108</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Legislature consists of two Chambers. This makes the Governor constitutional head like the President and determines the character of' State Government of Executive as a Parliamentary Government of Executive.<br>LEGISLATIVE POWERS The most important Legislative power or the Governor is his ordinance making power, This Ordinance making power is similar to that of the President. Under Article 123, whenever the Legislature is not in session and if the Government is satisfied that circumstances exist which require him to take immediate action, he may legislate by Ordinance, however the Governor cannot issue an Ordinance without previous instruction from the President in case in which–<br>(a) Bill would have required his previous sanction, or<br>(b) required to be reserved under the Constitution for the assent of the President.<br>FINANCIAL POWERS A money bill cannot be introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the State without the recommendation of the Governor. No demand of grants can be made except on the recommendation of the Governor. The Governor is required to cause to be laid before the House or Houses of the Legislature the annual financial statement, known as Budget.<br>JUDICIAL POWERS The Governor of a State is empowered to grant pardon, reprieve, respite, or remission, of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence in respect of any offence against any Law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends. [Art. 161].<br>The power of granting pardon under Article 161 is very wide and does not contain any limitation as to the time on which and the occasion on which and the circumstances in which the said power could be exercised. But the said power being a constitutional power is subject to judicial review on certain limited grounds. The Court, therefore, would be justified in interfering with an order passed by the Governor in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution, if the Governor is found to have exercised the power himself without being advised by the Government or if the Governor transgresses the jurisdiction in exercising the same or it is established that the Governor has passed the order without the application of mind or the order in question is a malafide one or the Governor has passed the order on some extraneous consideration.<br>Governors do not have diplomatic, military and emergency powers which the President has.<br>The Governor of Assam has certain discretionary powers in tribal affairs in which he is not required to act according to the advice of his Ministers.<br>The President also has certain discretionary powers. The executive powers of the Governor is subject to and limited in some respects by the executive power of the President to whom the Governor is required to report situation requiring the proclamation of emergency.<br>The President and the Governors have all got the power to veto legislation by withholding their assent to it.<br>108</p><hr><h3>Page 109</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I COUNCIL OF MINISTERS According to Article 163(1) there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to 'aid and advise' the Governor. The Council of Ministers in the State is constituted and functions in the same way as the Union Cabinet.<br>The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor. As a matter of a well established convention it is the leader of the Legislative Assembly who should be appointed as the Chief Minister. Thus in normal circumstances the choice of the Governor is limited to the leader of the majority party.<br>But there may be circumstances where the Governor would have to exercise his discretion in selecting the Chief Minister. The other ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. In the appointment of other ministers the Chief Minister has the final say because it is the Chief Minister who has to run the Government. This is, indeed, necessary in order to ensure the successful operation of the rule of collective responsibility.<br>The Governor may appoint a person as a Chief Minister or a Minister who is not a member of either House of the State Legislature. But he must be elected to the House of State Legislature within the period of six months. If he does not become member of the Legislature within the six months of his appointment as Chief Minister or Minister he will cease to be Chief Minister or Minister. Before a Minister enters upon his office, the Governor is to administer to him the prescribed oath of office and secrecy.<br>A person convicted of criminal offence and sentenced to more than two years of imprisonment cannot be appointed as Chief Minister.'<br>According to Article 164(1), the ministers shall hold office during the 'pleasure' of the Governor. But this pleasure is to be exercisable by the, Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. This follows from Clause (2) of Article 164 which says that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State.<br>Till the ministry enjoys the confidence of the Lower House of a State, the Governor is bound to accept the advice of the Chief Minister. Indeed, it would be strange that a ministry responsible for its acts and policies to the legislature can be dismissed by the Governor. This means that a minister holds office during the pleasure of the Chief Minister. The Governor is bound to dismiss a Minister as and when advised by the Chief Minister. It is only then that the smooth functioning of the principle of collective responsibility can be maintained.<br>Article 167(a) says that it is the duty of Chief Minister of State to communicate all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the State and proposals for legislation. If the Governor asks him to furnish such information it is the duty of the Chief Minister to do so. The Chief Minister, if required by the Governor, will also submit for consideration of the cabinet any matter on which a decision has been taken by a Minister which has not been considered by the cabinet.<br>Article 167(c) further strengthens the rule of collective responsibility and gives power to the Chief Minister to review the decision taken by any minister individually. When a decision is taken by any minister without reference to the cabinet, Governor may require it to be considered by the cabinet.<br>The Governor cannot override a decision of Minister. If the cabinet stands behind him the minister remains and the Governor is bound to accept his decision. If, however, the cabinet does not uphold his decision he will have to quit the ministry. If he insists to remain he will be dismissed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. It is a safeguard which ensures the working of the 109</p><hr><h3>Page 110</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.)

But the Parliament has the power to establish a common High Court for two or more States (Article 231).<br>In India, neither the State executive nor the State Legislature has any power to control the High Courts or two after its Constitution or organisation. It is only Parliament which can do it. In case of Union Territories the Parliament may by Law extend the jurisdiction of a High Court to or exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court from any Union Territory, or create a High Court for a Union Territory.<br>Thus Delhi, a Union Territory, has a separate High Court of its own while the Madras High Court has jurisdiction over Pondicherry, the Kerala High Court over Lakshadweep and Mumbai High Court over Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Kolkata High Court over Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Punjab High court over Chandigarh.<br>Composition of High Courts:<br>i. Every High Court shall consists of a Chief Justice and such other judges as the President of India may from time to time appoint.<br>ii. Besides, the President has the power to appoint<br>(a) Additional Judges for a temporary period not exceeding two years, for the clearance of areas of work in a High Court;<br>(b) an acting judge, when a permanent judge of a High Court (other than Chief Justice) is temporarily absent or unable to perform his duties or is appointed to act temporarily as Chief Justice.<br>112</p><hr><h3>Page 113</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I But neither an additional nor an acting Judge can hold office beyond the age of 62 years age of retirement raised from 60 to 62.<br>Appointment and Conditions of Office of a Judge of a High Court:<br>Every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President. In making the appointment,<br>the President shall consult the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State (and also the Chief Justice of that High Court in the matter of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice).<br>Tenure: A Judge of the High Court shall hold office until the age of 62 years. Every Judge, permanent,<br>additional or acting, may vacate his office earlier in any of the following ways-<br>(i) by resignation in writing addressed to the President;<br>(ii) by being appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court or being transferred to any other High Court, by the President;<br>(iii) by removal by the President on an address of both Houses of Parliament (supported by the vote of 2/3 of the members present) on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity,.<br>The mode of removal of a Judge of the High Court shall thus be the same as that of a judge of the Supreme Court.<br>Salary and Allowances of the Judges:<br>It is provided that the judges of the High Court shall draw such salaries and allowances, as the Parliament may by Law fix from time to time. In addition they will also be entitled to receive other prescribed allowances.<br>By providing the expenditure salaries and allowances the judges shall be charged on the consolidated fund of State. These cannot be reduced except in financial emergency. Nor can the allowances and rights be varied by Parliament to the disadvantage of a judge during his/her term of office.<br>INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES ENSURED As in the case of the Judges of the Supreme Court, the Constitution seeks to maintain the indepen-<br>dence of the Judges of the High Court’s by a number of provisions:-<br>(i) By laying down that a Judge of the High Court shall not be removed, except in the manner provided for the removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court (Article 218);<br>(ii) by providing that the expenditure in respect of the salaries and allowances of the Judges shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State [Article 202 (3)(d)];<br>(iii) by specifying in the Constitution the salaries payable to the Judges and providing that the allowances of a Judge or his rights in respect of absence or pension shall not be varied by Parliament to his disadvantage after his appointment (Article 221) except under a Proclamation of Financial Emergency [Article 360 (4)(b)].<br>(iv) by laying down that after retirement a permanent Judge of High Court shall not plead or act in a Court or before any authority in India, except the Supreme Court and a High Court other than the -High Court in which he had held his office (Article 220).<br>Control of the Union over High Court:<br>The control of the Union over a High Court in India is exercised in the following matters:<br>(i) Appointment, (Article 217), transfer from one High Court to another (Article 222) and removal [Article 217(1)] and determination of dispute as to age of Judges of High Courts<br>[Article 217 (3)];<br>(ii) the Constitution and organisation of High Courts and the power to establish a common High Court for two or more States (Article 231); and<br>(iii) to extend the jurisdiction of a High Court to, or to exclude it jurisdiction from, a Union Territory, are all exclusive powers of the Union Parliament (Article 231).<br>113</p><hr><h3>Page 114</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I Jurisdiction of High Courts:<br>The constitution does not attempt detailed definitions or classification of the different types of jurisdiction of the High Courts. It was presumed that the High Court’s which were functioning with well- defined jurisdiction at the time of the framing of the Constitution would continue with it and maintain their position as the highest courts in the States. The Constitution, accordingly, provided that the High Courts would retain their existing jurisdiction and any future Law that was to be made by the Legislatures.<br>Besides, the original and appellate jurisdiction, the Constitution vested in the High Court’s four additional powers:<br>i. The power to issue writs or orders for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights or for any other purpose;<br>ii. the power of superintendence over subordinate courts;<br>iii. the power to transfer cases to themselves pending in the subordinate courts involving interpretation of the Constitution; and iv. the power to appoint officers.<br>(a) Original and Appellate Jurisdiction:<br>The High Courts are primarily courts of appeal. Only in matters of admiralty, probate,<br>matrimonial, contempt of Court, enforcement of Fundamental Rights and cases ordered to be transferred from a lower court involving the interpretation of the Constitution to their own file, they have original jurisdiction. The High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras exercise original civil jurisdiction when the amount involved exceeds specified limit. In criminal cases it extends to case committed to them by Presidency Magistrates.<br>On the appeal side they entertain appeals in civil and criminal cases from their subordinate courts as well as from their original side. For historical reasons and as a result of the specific provisions in the Government of India Act, 1935, no High Court has any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning revenue. In 1950 Constitution removed this restriction.<br>(b) Power of Superintendence and Transfer:<br>Every High Court has a power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territory in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, excepting military tribunals [Art. 227]. This power of superintendence is a very wide power in as much as it extends to all courts as well as tribunals within the State, whether such court or tribunal is subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court or not.<br>Further, this power of superintendence would include a revisional jurisdiction to intervene in case of gross injustice or non-exercise of abuse of jurisdiction, even though no appeal or revision against the orders of such tribunal was otherwise available.<br>However, this jurisdiction of High Court has been taken away in respect of Administrative Tribunals set up under Article 323A, by the administrative Tribunals Act. 1985. If the High Court is satisfied that a case pending in a court subordinate to it involves a substantial question of Law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, it may transfer the case of itself.<br>After the case has come to the file of the High Court, it may dispose of the whole case itself, or may determine the constitutional questions involved and return the case to the court from which it has been withdrawn together with a copy of its judgement on such question and direct it to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgement.<br>The Constitution, thus, denies to subordinate courts the right to interpret the Constitution so that there may be the maximum possible uniformity as regards constitutional decisions. It is accordingly, the duty of the subordinate courts to refer to the High Court a case which involves a substantial question of Law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and the case cannot be disposed of without the determination of such question. The High Court may also transfer the case to itself upon the application of the party in the case.<br>114</p><hr><h3>Page 115</h3><p>Class –LL.B (HONS.) I SEM. Subject – Constitutional Law-I<br>(c) Writ Jurisdiction:<br>Article 226 of the Constitution empowers every High Court, throughout the territories in relation to its which exercises jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those territories, directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warrantor and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights and for any other purpose.<br>The Constitution by Forty-second amendment omitted the provision “for any other purpose”,<br>but the Forty-fourth amendment has restored it. The peculiarity of this jurisdiction is that being conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be taken away or abridged by anything short of an amendment of the Constitution itself.<br>Although the Supreme Court and the High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction in the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, the Constitution does not confer to the High Court’s the special responsibility of protecting Fundamental Rights as the Supreme Court is vested with such a power.<br>Under Article 32 the Supreme Court is made the guarantor and protector, of Fundamental Rights whereas in the case of High court the power to enforce Fundamental Rights is part of their general jurisdiction.<br>The jurisdiction to issue writs under these Articles is larger in the case of High Court in as much as while the Supreme Court can issue them only where a fundamental right has been infringed, a High Court can issue them not only in such cases but also where an ordinary legal right has been infringed, provided a writ is a proper remedy in such cases, according to well-established principles.<br>(d) Court of Record:<br>The High Court is a court of record and has all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. The two characteristics of a court of record are that the records of such a Court are admitted to be of evidentiary value and that they cannot be questioned when produced before any court and that it has the power to punish for contempt of itself. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Legislature can deprive a High Court of its power of punishing contempt of itself.<br>OFFICERS AND SERVANTS AND THE EXPENSES OF HIGH COURTS Article 229 of the Constitution says:<br>(a) Appointments of officers and servants of a High Court are made by the Chief Justice of the High Court.<br>(b) Subject to the provisions of any Law made by the Legislature of the State, the conditions of service of Officers and servants of a High Court shall be such as may be prescribed by the rules made by the Chief Justice of the High Court.<br>(c) The administrative expenses of the High Court including all salaries, allowances, etc. are charged upon the Consolidated Fund of the State.<br>115</p><hr></body></html>
